<p class='pindent'>“The earl is out, sir—and so is Lord William;”
said the obsequious lacquey, as I was ushered into
Fairlie Hall, “will you amuse yourself in the library
until dinner, or take a stroll in the park? You will
probably meet with some of the family about the
grounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the salutation that greeted me on alighting
at the princely mansion of the earl of Fairlie,
whither I had come at the invitation of his only son—one
of my inseparable friends at Oxford. The visit
had been promised for more than two years; and I
was actuated to it, not only by the desire of spending
the vacation with my friend, but by a lurking wish
to behold the Lady Katharine, his only sister, whose
beauty I had heard extolled by a hundred lips. So I
had given up a contemplated run to the continent and
come down to Fairlie Hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After changing my dress and gazing from the windows
of my chamber, I began to feel ennuied and
descending the ample staircase I determined on a
stroll into the magnificent park, which surrounded
the hall for some miles on every hand. My walk
led me by a wild woodland path into one of the most
romantic recesses of the forest. Naturally of a
dreamy cast of mind, I walked on in a sort of reverie,
until I was suddenly recalled to my more sober
senses by coming in front of a little summer house,
perched airily on a rock, and overlooking a mimic
waterfall. Feeling somewhat fatigued with my day’s
travel, I walked in and sat down. There was little
furniture in the room, but on a table in the centre,
lay a copy of Spencer, as if some one had lately been
there. Picking up my favorite poet I began reading,
but whether the interminable allegory exercised a
drowsy influence over me, or whether it was the
sharp morning air in which I had been riding that
affected me, I cannot say, but in a few minutes I fell
into a light doze, such a one as while it gives a
dreamy character to our thoughts, or lulls them
altogether into repose, never assumes wholly the
character of sleep, and is dissipated by the slightest
noise. Mine was soon broken, by a quick light step
on the greensward without, and a musical female
voice singing a gay ditty. Starting up I beheld an
apparition standing in the door of the summer house,
whose exceeding loveliness I was doubtful, for a moment,
whether to refer to earth or heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This apparition bore the form of a young lady
apparently about eighteen, of a tall shapely figure,
attired in a light summer dress—the sleeves of which,
being looped up at the shoulders, revealed a pair of
exquisitely rounded arms which might have vied
with those of the fabled Euphrosyne. Her dress
came low down towards the bust, displaying the full
charms of her unrivalled shoulders and all the graceful
swelling of her snowy and swan-like neck. Her
face was of the true oval shape, and on either side
of it flowed down her luxuriant auburn ringlets.
The features, without being regular, formed a combination
of surpassing beauty. The delicately arched
eye-brows; the finely chiselled nose; the small
round chin; the rich lips whose luxuriance rivalled
that of the full blown rose; and the smooth pearly
cheek, through which the vermeil blood might be
seen wandering in ten thousand tiny veins—so transparent
was the hue of the skin—united to form a
countenance which would have been beautiful, even
without the constantly changing expression which
gave animation to each feature. The appearance of
this wondrously lovely being, just as I awoke from
the half dreamy sleep I have described, in which the
visions of the poet and the sound of the waterfall had
contributed to fill my mind with fantastic images,
made me doubt, for a moment, whether the heavenly
Una herself or one of her attendant nymphs had
not emerged on my dreaming vision. But the changing
expressing of her features soon convinced me
that she was no airy visitant. At first a look of surprise
darted over her fine countenance, and she retreated
a step backwards, while the blood mantled
her cheek, brow, and bosom, and even tinged the
ends of her delicate fingers. In an instant, however,
she regained her composure. No so myself. I had
been equally startled, but was longer in recovering
my ease. A silence of a minute thus occurred,
during which we stood awkwardly regarding each
other, but at length the ludicrousness of the scene
striking the fancy of the fair apparition, she burst
into a merry laugh, in which, despite my wounded
vanity, I was forced to follow her. She had now
fully recovered from her momentary embarrassment
and advancing said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Stanhope I presume, for we have been expecting
you for some days.” I bowed. “I see I
must introduce myself. The Lady Katharine,
daughter of the Earl of Fairlie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This then was the Lady Katharine of whom I had
heard so much! There was something in the gaiety
and originality of the address that pleased me, while
at the same time it increased my embarrassment. I
bowed again and was about to reply, but in bowing
I inadvertently made a step backwards, and trod on
a pet greyhound, which accompanied this wilful creature.
The animal with a cry sought shelter by its
mistress’ side, who, by this time, had sunk into one
of the seats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Lama,” she said petting him, “you must
be careful how you get in the way of a bashful gallant
again,” and then, turning to me, she said in a
tone of gay raillery. “Ah, Mr. Stanhope, you Oxford
gentlemen, knowing as you are in history, Greek,
and Latin, are all alike awkward at a bow—at least
William is so, and his particular friend of whom I
have heard so much, and of whom I really hoped
otherwise, is no better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was much in this galling to my vanity, but
it carried with it some alleviation. I had then been
the subject of conversation with this fair being, and
she had thought favorably of me. This idea did
much to restore me to the use of my tongue, which
otherwise would have been gone forever, under the
merciless raillery of the Lady Katharine. Besides I
saw that I was losing ground with my fair companion,
and that it was necessary to call some assurance
to my aid. I rallied therefore and replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me not be condemned without trial. Lady
Katharine may yet soften her sentence—or at least
in the court of fashion over which she is queen, I
may have a chance of improvement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a tone of easy badinage in this, so different
from what she had been led to expect from my
former embarrassment, that the lady looked up in
unaffected surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, I declare—you improve on acquaintance.
Why you have almost earned for yourself
the favor of being my knight homewards—quite indeed,
only that you have lamed my poor Lama. So
I must even leave you to Spencer, which I see you
have been reading, and depart. We will meet at
dinner and I will see by that time if you have improved
in your bows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so, fair lady,” said I, “Spencer would never
forgive me, and I would indeed be unworthy to be
called true knight, if I permitted damsel to brave the
perils of this enchanted forest alone.” And I started
forward to accompany her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at me a minute dubiously, as if puzzled
what to make of my character, as she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pardon you, for this once, and allow you to accompany
me. We shall,” she continued, looking at
her watch, “have scarcely time to reach the hall
before the dinner bell will sound.” And with the
words, off she tripped, with a bound as free as that
of her agile greyhound. I followed, determined not
to be outdone, but to maintain the gay rattling tone I
had assumed, as the only one fitted to cope with this
wilful creature. I had so far succeeded that when
we parted at the hall to dress for dinner, I really believe
she would have been puzzled to say what part
of my conversation had been serious or what not.
She must have been completely in the dark as to my
real sentiments on any one of the many subjects we
had discussed. Indeed she admitted as much to me
at dinner, where I managed to secure a place beside
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a perfect puzzle—do you know it, Mr.
Stanhope? At least I have not yet decided what to
think of you. At first I set you down for the most
bashful young man I had ever seen, and now you
seem as if nothing could intimidate you. Why,
when pa was introduced to you, you talked politics
with him as if you had known him for years, and
three minutes after you were discussing the fashions
with little Miss Mowbray, as if you had been a man-milliner
all your life. I scarcely know whether to
think you a cameleon, or attribute your wit to the
champaigne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither, Lady Katharine, while a better reason
may be found nearer home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! that wasn’t so badly said, although a little
too plain. We ladies like flattery well enough, but
then it must be disguised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And it would be almost impossible to flatter you!—is
that it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You puzzle me to tell, I declare, whether that is
a compliment or otherwise—but see, pa is waiting
to drink champaigne with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In such gay conversation passed the dinner and
evening; and when I retired for the night it was
with the consciousness that I was in a fair way to fall
in love with the Lady Katharine. I lay awake for
some two hours, thinking of all I had said and of her
replies; and I came to the conclusion that she was,
beyond measure not only the loveliest but the most
fascinating of her sex.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I had been among the first of the numerous guests
to arrive; but the remainder followed so close after
me that in a few days the whole company had assembled.
It was an unusually gay party. The morning
was generally spent by the gentlemen in shooting
among the preserves, leaving the ladies to their indoor
recreations or a ride around the park. On
these rides the gentlemen sometimes accompanied
them. Lady Katharine was always the star of the
party; it was around her our sex gathered. But,
fascinating as I felt her to be I was, of all the beaux,
the most seldom found at her bridle-rein; and perhaps
this comparatively distant air was the most effectual
means I could have taken to forward my
suit. At least I fancied more than once that I piqued
the Lady Katharine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We still kept up the tone of badinage with which
our acquaintance had commenced. There was a
playful wit about the Lady Katharine which was irresistible;
and I flattered myself that she was pleased
with my conversation, perhaps because it was different
from that of her suitors in general. But
whether her liking for me extended further than to
my qualities as a drawing-room companion I was
unable to tell. If I strove to hide my love from her,
she was equally successful in concealing her feelings
whatever they might be. Yet she gave me the
credit of being a keen observer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You take more notice of little things than any
one of your sex I ever saw,” she said to me one
evening. “The ladies have a way of reading one’s
sentiments by trifles, which your sex generally deem
beneath its notice. But you! one would almost fear
your finding out all one thinks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! not at all,” said I. “At any rate, if your
sex are such keen observers they are also apt at concealment.
What lady that has not striven to hide
from her lover that she returned his passion, at least
until he has proposed, and that even though aware
how wholly he adores her? We all alike play a
part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shame, shame, Mr. Stanhope! Would you have
us surrender our only protection, by betraying our
sentiments too soon? And then to say that we all
play a part, as if hypocrisy—in little things, it is
true, but still <span class='it'>hypocrisy</span>—was an every-day affair.
You make me ashamed of human nature. You
really cannot believe what you say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was spoken with a warmth that convinced
me the words were from the heart. I felt that however
flippant the Lady Katharine might be to the
vain and empty suitors that usually thronged around
her, she had a heart—a warm, true, woman’s heart—a
heart that beat with noble emotions and was susceptible
to all the finer feelings of love. I would
have replied, but at this instant the Duke of Chovers
approached and requested the honor of waltzing
with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Duke of Chovers was a young man of about
five and twenty. The calibre of his mind was that
of fashionable men in general; but then he enjoyed
a splendid fortune and wore the ducal coronet. He
was confessedly the best match of the season. The
charms of the Lady Katharine had been the first to
divert his mind from his dress and horses. It was
whispered that a union was already arranged betwixt
him and my fair companion. As if to confirm
this rumor, he always took his place by her bridle-rein.
The worldly advantages of such a connexion
were unanswerable; and I had been tortured by
uneasy fears ever since I heard the rumor. Now
was a fair opportunity to learn the truth. I had heard
the Lady Katharine jestingly say a few days before,
in describing a late ball, that she refused to waltz
with Lord —— because she thought him unmarried,
and that when she discovered her mistake she was
piqued at herself for losing the handsomest partner
in the room. The remark was made jestingly and
casually, and was by this time forgotten by her.
But I still remembered it. Yet I know that if she
was betrothed to him she would accept his offer.
How my heart thrilled, therefore, when I heard her
decline it! His grace walked away unable to conceal
his mortification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should not be so hard-hearted,” said I, “although
the duke ought have known that you waltz
with none of the proscribed race of bachelors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at me in unaffected surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did you discover that?” she said. “We
have had no waltzing since you came,” and then,
reflecting that these hasty words had confirmed my
bold assertion, she blushed to the very brow and
looked for a moment confused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our conversation was interrupted by her brother
and one or two new acquaintances who had driven
home with him. I soon sauntered away. My deductions
respecting her and the duke were shaken, I confess,
before the evening was over, by seeing them sitting
<span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span>, by one of the casements, while the
guests avoided them, as if by that tacit agreement
under which lovers are left to themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attentions of his grace became daily more
marked, and there was an evident embarrassment of
manner in the Lady Katharine under them. A month
slipped away meanwhile, and the time when the
company was to break up drew near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were out on a ride one morning, and the duke,
as usual, had established himself at her bridle-rein,
when, in cantering along the brow of a somewhat
precipitous hill, overlooking the country for miles
around, the horse of the Lady Katharine took fright,
from some cause, and dashed towards the edge
of a precipice that sank sheer down for nearly a
hundred feet. The precipice was several hundred
yards to the right, but the pace at which the frighted
steed went, threatened soon to bring him up with it,
while the efforts of the rider to alter his course appeared
to be unavailing. Our party was paralyzed,
and his grace particularly so. I alone retained my
presence of mind. Driving my spurs deep into the
flanks of my steed, I plunged forward at full gallop,
amid the shrieks of the females and the warnings
of the gentlemen of the party. But I knew I could
trust my gallant hunter. The Lady Katharine heard
my horse’s hoofs, and turned around. Never shall I
forget her pleading look. I dashed my rowels again
into Arab, for only a few paces yet remained betwixt
the Lady Katharine’s frightened animal and the edge
of the precipice. One more leap and all would have
been over; but luckily at that instant I came head
and head with her furious steed, and catching him by
the bridle, I swung him around with a superhuman
strength. But I was only partially successful. The
animal plunged and snorted, and nearly jerked me
from the saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s sake dismount, my dear Lady Katharine,
as well as you can, or all is over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The daring girl hesitated no more, but seizing a
favorable instant when the animal, though trembling
all over, stood nearly still, she leaped to the earth.
The next instant her steed plunged more wildly than
ever, and seeing that she was safe I let go the bridle.
He snorted, dashed forward and went headlong over
the precipice. In an instant I had dismounted and
was by the Lady Katharine’s side. I was just in
time to catch her in my arms as she fainted away.
Before she recovered, the landau, with the rest of the
party, came up. I saw her in the hands of her
mother, and then giving reins to Arab, under pretence
of sending medical aid, but in reality to escape
the gratulations of the company, I dashed off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I entered the drawing-room before dinner,
there was no one in the apartment but the Lady Katharine.
She looked pale, but on recognizing me, a
deep blush suffused her cheek and brow, while her
eye lit up for the instant, with an expression of dewy
tenderness that made every vein in my body thrill.
But these traces of emotion passed as rapidly as they
came, leaving her manner as it usually was, only
that there was an unnatural restraint about it, as if
her feelings of gratitude were struggling with others
of a different character. She rose, however, and
extended her hand. There was nothing of its usual
light tone in her voice, but an expression of deep seriousness,
perhaps emotion, as she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How shall I ever thank you sufficiently, Mr.
Stanhope, for saving my life?” and that same dewy
tenderness again shone from her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By never alluding, my dear Lady Katharine, to
this day’s occurrence. I have only done what every
other gentleman would have done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sighed. Was she thinking of the tardiness of
the duke? I thought so, and sighed too. She looked
up suddenly, with her large full eyes fixed on me,
as if she would read my very soul; while a deep
roseate blush suffused her face and crimsoned even
her shoulders and bosom. There was something in
that look that changed the whole current of my convictions,
and bid me hope. In the impulse of the
moment, I took her hand. Again that conscious
blush rushed over her cheek and bosom; but this
time her eyes sought the ground. My brain reeled.
At length I found words, and, in burning language
poured forth my hopes and fears, and told the tale
of my love. I ceased; her bosom heaved wildly,
but she did not answer. I still knelt at her feet. At
length she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in the tone, rather than in
the word, which assured me I was beloved. If I
needed further confirmation of this it was given in
the look of confiding tenderness with which she
gazed an instant on me, and then averted her eyes
tremblingly. I stole my arm around her, and drew
her gently toward me. In a moment she looked up
again half reproachfully, and gently disengaged herself
from my embrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have been playing a part, dear Lady Katharine!”
said I, still retaining her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gay smile, for the instant, shot over her face,
but was lost as quickly in the tenderness which was
now its prevailing expression, as she said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid we have! But now, Henry, <span class='it'>dear</span>
Henry, let me steal away, for one moment, before
they descend to dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I restrained her only to press my first kiss on her
odorous lips, and then she darted from the room,
leaving me in a tumult of feelings I cannot attempt
to describe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The duke had never been the Lady Katharine’s
choice, and she had only waited for him to propose
in form to herself personally, to give him a decided
refusal. Although I was but the heir of a commoner—of
a wealthy and ancient family it is true; and he
was the possessor of a dukedom, she had loved me,
as I had loved her, from the first moment we had
met. The duke had been backed by her parents, but
when we both waited on them, and told them that
our happiness depended on their consent, they sacrificed
rank to the peace of their daughter, and gave
it without reluctance. Before winter came the Lady
Katharine was my <span class='sc'>Bride</span>.</p>

<div><h1><a id='cent'></a>CENTRE HARBOR, N. H.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>This town is situated on one of the three bays
jutting out at the north-western extremity of Lake
Winnipiseogee—a sheet of water situated near the
centre of New Hampshire, and celebrated for its
picturesque beauty. The lake is diversified with
innumerable islands and promontories. It is seen,
perhaps, to the best advantage from Red Hill, whence
a magic landscape of hill, island and water stretches
far away beneath the beholder’s feet. The name of
Winnipiseogee signifies in the Indian language “the
beautiful lake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The view from Centre Harbor has always won the
admiration of tourists, there being a quiet beauty
about it which few can resist. The best view is from
the highlands back of the town. The place itself is
small, and lies immediately beneath the gazer’s feet;
but the lake, diversified with its green islands, and
shut in by its rolling hills, instantly arrests the eye.
In the quiet of a summer noon, or under a clear
moonlit sky, there is a depth of repose brooding over
the scene which seems akin to magic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lake is, in some places, unfathomable, but
abounds with fish. At present it boasts little navigation,
for the comparatively thinly scattered population
on its borders has not yet ruffled its quiet waters
with the keels of commerce. It is yet protected
from the ravages of utilitarianism; and the lover of
the picturesque will pray that it may long continue so.</p>

<div><h1><a id='mask'></a>THE MASK OF THE RED DEATH.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A FANTASY.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY EDGAR A. POE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “Red Death” had long devastated the country.
No pestilence had been ever so fatal, or so
hideous. Blood was its Avator and its seal—the
redness and the horror of blood. There were sharp
pains, and sudden dizziness, and then profuse bleedings
at the pores, with dissolution. The scarlet stains
upon the body and especially upon the face of the
victim, were the pest-ban which shut him out from
the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men.
And the whole seizure, progress and termination of
the disease were the incidents of half an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless,
and sagacious. When his dominions were half depopulated,
he summoned to his presence a thousand
hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights
and dames of his court, and with these retired to the
deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys.
This was an extensive and magnificent structure, the
creation of the prince’s own eccentric yet august
taste. A strong and lofty wall girdled it in. This wall
had gates of iron. The courtiers, having entered,
brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded
the bolts. They resolved to leave means neither of
ingress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair
from without or of frenzy from within. The abbey
was amply provisioned. With such precautions the
courtiers might bid defiance to contagion. The external
world could take care of itself. In the meantime
it was folly to grieve, or to think. The prince
had provided all the appliances of pleasure. There
were buffoons, there were improvisatori, there were
ballêt-dancers, there were musicians, there were
cards, there was Beauty, there was wine. All these
and security were within. Without was the “Red
Death.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was towards the close of the fifth or sixth
month of his seclusion, and while the pestilence raged
most furiously abroad, that the Prince Prospero entertained
his thousand friends at a masked ball of
the most unusual magnificence. It was a voluptuous
scene that masquerade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was
held. There were seven—an imperial suite. In many
palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight
vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to
the walls on either hand, so that the view of the
whole extent is scarcely impeded. Here the case
was very different; as might have been expected
from the duke’s love of the <span class='it'>bizarre</span>. The apartments
were so irregularly disposed that the vision
embraced but little more than one at a time. There
was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards, and
at each turn a novel effect. To the right and left,
in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic
window looked out upon a closed corridor which
pursued the windings of the suite. These windows
were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance
with the prevailing hue of the decorations of
the chamber into which it opened. That at the
eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue—and
vividly blue were its windows. The second
chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries,
and here the panes were purple. The third was
green throughout, and so were the casements. The
fourth was furnished and litten with orange—the
fifth with white—the sixth with violet. The seventh
apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries
that hung all over the ceiling and down the
walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the
same material and hue. But, in this chamber only,
the color of the windows failed to correspond with
the decorations. The panes here were scarlet—a
deep blood color. Now in no one of the seven apartments
was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the
profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to
and fro or depended from the roof. There was no
light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle
within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors
that followed the suite, there stood, opposite to each
window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brasier of fire
that projected its rays through the tinted glass and
so glaringly illumined the room. And thus were
produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances.
But in the western or black chamber the effect
of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark
hangings through the blood-tinted panes, was ghastly
in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon
the countenances of those who entered, that there
were few of the company bold enough to set foot
within its precincts at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in this apartment, also, that there stood
against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony.
Its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull, heavy, monotonous
clang; and when its minute-hand made the
circuit of the face, and the hour was to be stricken,
there came forth from the brazen lungs of the clock
a sound which was clear and loud and deep and
exceedingly musical, but of so peculiar a note and
emphasis that, at each lapse of an hour, the musicians
in the orchestra were constrained to pause,
momently, in their performance, to hearken to the
sound; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their
evolutions; and there was a brief disconcert of the
whole gay company; and, while the chimes of the
clock yet rang, it was observed that the giddiest grew
pale, and that the more aged and sedate passed their
hands over their brows as if in confused reverie or
meditation. But when the echoes had fully ceased,
a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the
musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at
their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering
vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of
the clock should produce in them no similar emotion;
and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes,
(which embrace three thousand and six hundred
seconds of the Time that flies,) there came yet another
chiming of the clock, and then there were the same disconcert
and tremulousness and meditation as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent
revel. The tastes of the duke were peculiar.
He had a fine eye for colors and effects. He disregarded
the <span class='it'>decora</span> of mere fashion. His plans were
bold and fiery, and his conceptions glowed with barbaric
lustre. There are some who would have
thought him mad. His followers felt that he was
not. It was necessary to hear and see and touch
him to be <span class='it'>sure</span> that he was not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had directed, in great part, the moveable embellishments
of the seven chambers, upon occasion
of this great <span class='it'>fête</span>, and it was his own guiding taste
which had given character to the costumes of the
masqueraders. Be sure they were grotesque. There
were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm—much
of what has been since seen in “Hernani.”
There were arabesque figures with unsuited
limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies
such as the madman fashions. There was much
of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the
<span class='it'>bizarre</span>, something of the terrible, and not a little of
that which might have excited disgust. To and fro
in the seven chambers there stalked, in fact, a multitude
of dreams. And these, the dreams—writhed in
and about, taking hue from the rooms, and causing
the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo
of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony
clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And
then, momently, all is still, and all is silent save the
voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as
they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away—they
have endured but an instant—and a light, half-subdued
laughter floats after them as they depart.
And now again the music swells, and the dreams
live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever,
taking hue from the many-tinted windows through
which stream the rays from the tripods. But to the
chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven
there are now none of the maskers who venture; for
the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier
light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness
of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose
foot falls upon the sable carpet, there comes from the
near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly
emphatic than any which reaches <span class='it'>their</span> ears who
indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other
apartments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But these other apartments were densely crowded,
and in them beat feverishly the heart of life. And
the revel went whirlingly on, until at length was
sounded the twelfth hour upon the clock. And then
the music ceased, as I have told; and the evolutions
of the waltzers were quieted; and there was an uneasy
cessation of all things as before. But now there
were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the
clock; and thus it happened, perhaps, that more of
thought crept, with more of time, into the meditations
of the thoughtful among those who revelled.
And thus, again, it happened, perhaps, that before
the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk
into silence, there were many individuals in the
crowd who had found leisure to become aware of
the presence of a masked figure which had arrested
the attention of no single individual before. And the
rumor of this new presence having spread itself
whisperingly around, there arose at length from the
whole company a buzz, or murmur, expressive at
first of disapprobation and surprise—then, finally, of
terror, of horror, and of disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted,
it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance
could have excited such sensation. In truth the
masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited;
but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod,
and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince’s
indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts
of the most reckless which cannot be touched without
emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom
life and death are equally jests, there <span class='it'>are</span> matters of
which no jest can be properly made. The whole
company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in
the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit
nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt,
and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of
the grave. The mask which concealed the visage
was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of
a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have
had difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all
this might have been endured, if not approved, by
the mad revellers around. But the mummer had
gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death.
His vesture was dabbled in <span class='it'>blood</span>—and his broad
brow, with all the features of the face, was besprinkled
with the scarlet horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the eyes of the Prince Prospero fell upon
this spectral image (which with a slow and solemn
movement, as if more fully to sustain its <span class='it'>rôle</span>, stalked
to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be
convulsed, in the first moment, with a strong shudder
either of terror or distaste; but, in the next, his brow
reddened with rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who dares?” he demanded hoarsely of the
group that stood around him, “who dares thus to
make mockery of our woes? Uncase the varlet that
we may know whom we have to hang to-morrow
at sunrise from the battlements. Will no one stir
at my bidding?—stop him and strip him, I say, of
those reddened vestures of sacrilege!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the eastern or blue chamber in which
stood the Prince Prospero as he uttered these words.
They rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and
clearly—for the prince was a bold and robust man,
and the music had become hushed at the waving of
his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in the blue room where stood the prince,
with a group of pale courtiers by his side. At first,
as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of
this group in the direction of the intruder, who at
the moment was also near at hand, and now, with
deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to
the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with
which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired
the whole party, there were found none who
put forth hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he
passed within a yard of the prince’s person; and,
while the vast assembly, as if with one impulse,
shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls, he
made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same
solemn and measured step which had distinguished
him from the first, through the blue chamber to the
purple—through the purple to the green—through
the green to the orange,—through this again to the
white—and even thence to the violet, ere a decided
movement had been made to arrest him. It was
then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddening
with rage and the shame of his own momentary
cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers—while
none followed him on account of a
deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore
aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid
impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating
figure, when the latter, having attained the
extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly
round and confronted his pursuer. There was a
sharp cry—and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the
sable carpet, upon which instantly afterwards, fell
prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then, summoning
the wild courage of despair, a throng of the
revellers at once threw themselves into the black
apartment, and, seizing the mummer, whose tall
figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow
of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at
finding the grave-cerements and corpse-like mask
which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted
by any tangible form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now was acknowledged the presence of the
Red Death. He had come like a thief in the night.
And one by one dropped the revellers in the blood-bedewed
halls of their revel, and died each in the
despairing posture of his fall. And the life of the
ebony clock went out with that of the last of the
gay. And the flames of the tripods expired. And
Darkness and Decay and the Red Death held illimitable
dominion over all.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MRS. M. H. PARSONS.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow, I will do it to-morrow,” was the curse
of Lucy Clifton’s life. When a child, she always
had it in view to make such charming little dresses—to-morrow.
When girlhood came her lessons
were never perfect,—“only excuse me this once
mamma, and I will never put off my lessons again!”
The pleader was lovely, and engaging, mamma was
weakly indulgent; Lucy was forgiven and the fault
grew apace, until she rarely did any thing to-day,
that could be put off till to-morrow. She was a wife,
and the mother of two children, at the period our
story commences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a cultivated mind, most engaging manners,
and great beauty of form, and features, Lucy had already
lost all influence over the mind of her husband,
and was fast losing her hold on his affections. She
had been married when quite young, as so many
American girls unfortunately are, and with a character
scarcely formed, had been thrown into situations
of emergency and trial she was very unprepared to
encounter. Her husband was a physician, had been
but a year or two in practice, at the time of their
marriage. William Clifton was a young man of fine
abilities, and most excellent character; of quick temper,
and impatient, he was ever generous, and ready
to acknowledge his fault. When he married Lucy,
he thought her as near perfection as it was possible
for a woman to be; proportionate was his disappointment,
at finding the evil habit of procrastination, almost
inherent in her nature from long indulgence,
threatening to overturn the whole fabric of domestic
happiness his fancy had delighted to rear. There
was no order in his household, no comfort by his
fireside; and oftimes when irritated to bitter anger,
words escaped the husband, that fell crushingly on
the warm, affectionate heart of the wife. The evil
habit of procrastination had “grown with her growth”
no parental hand, kind in its severity, had lopped off
the excrescence, that now threatened to destroy her
peace, that shadowed by its evil consequences her
otherwise fair and beautiful character. In Lucy’s
sphere of life there was necessity for much self-exertion,
and active superintendance over the affairs of
her household. They lived retired; economy and
good management were essential to render the limited
income Doctor Clifton derived from his practice fully
adequate to their support—that income was steadily
on the increase, and his friends deemed the day not
far distant, when he would rise to eminence in his
profession. Lucy’s father, a man of considerable
wealth, but large family, had purchased a house,
furnished it, and presented it to Lucy; she was quite
willing to limit her visiting circle to a few friends, as
best suited with their present means. Surely William
Clifton was not unreasonable, when he looked
forward to a life of domestic happiness, with his
young and tenderly nurtured bride. He could not
know that her many bright excelling virtues of character
would be dimmed, by the growth of the <span class='it'>one
fault</span>, until a shadow lay on the pathway of his daily
life. If <span class='it'>mothers</span> could lift the dim curtain of the future,
and read the destiny of their children, they would see
neglected faults, piercing like sharp adders the
bosoms that bore them, and reproach mingling with
the agony, that she, who had moulded their young
minds, had not done her work aright!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was four years after their marriage, Doctor
Clifton entered the nursery hurriedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucy my dear, will you have my things in order
by twelve o’clock? I must leave home for two days,
perhaps longer, if I find the patient I am called to see
very ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes! I will see to them. What shall I do
with the child, William, he is so very fretful? How
I wish I had given him the medicine yesterday; he
is very troublesome!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you think he needs it, give it to him at once;”
said her husband abruptly, “and don’t I beg Lucy
forget my clothes.” He left the room, and Lucy
tried to hush baby to sleep, but baby would not go,
then the nurse girl who assisted her could not keep
him quiet, and the mother, as she had often been
before, became bewildered, and at a loss what to do
first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please ma’am what am I to get for dinner?”
said the cook, the only servant they kept in
the kitchen, putting her head in at the door, and looking
round with a half smile, on the littered room, and
squalling baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Directly, I shall be down directly Betty, I must
first get baby to sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well ma’am,” was the reply, and going
down an hour afterwards, Mrs. Clifton found Betty
with her feet stretched out and her arms folded one
over the other, comfortably seated before an open
window, intent in watching, and enjoying the movements
of every passer-by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Betty, Betty!” said her mistress angrily, “have
you nothing to do, that you sit so idly here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I waited for orders, ma’am.” Dinner was an
hour back, Lucy assisted for a short time herself, and
then went up stairs to arrange Clifton’s clothes.
Baby was screaming terribly, and Lucy half terrified
did <span class='it'>yesterday’s</span> work, by giving him a dose of medicine.
So the morning sped on. Clifton came in at
the appointed time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are my clothes in readiness, Lucy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She colored with vexation, and shame. “The baby
has been very cross; I have not indeed had time.
But I will go now.” Clifton went down to his solitary
dinner, and when he returned found Lucy busy
with her needle; it was evident even to his unskilled
eye there was much to be done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is impossible to wait. Give me the things as
they are; I am so accustomed to wearing my shirts
without buttons, and my stockings with holes in, that
I shall find it nothing new—nor more annoying than
I daily endure.” He threw the things carelessly
into his carpet-bag, and left the room, nor did he say
one kindly word in farewell, or affection. It was
this giving away to violent anger, and using harsh
language to his wife that had broken her spirit,
almost her heart. She never even thought of reforming
herself; she grieved bitterly, but hopelessly.
Surely it is better when man and wife are joined
together by the tie that “no man may put asunder,”
to strive seriously, and in affection to correct one
another’s faults? There is scarcely any defect of
character, that a husband, by taking the right method
may not cure; always providing his wife is not unprincipled.
But he must be very patient; bear for a
season; add to judicious counsel much tenderness
and affection; making it clear to her mind that love
for herself and solicitude for their mutual happiness
are the objects in view. Hard in heart, and with little
of woman’s devotion unto him to whom her faith is
plighted, must the wife be who could long resist.
Not such an one was Lucy Clifton; but her husband
in the stormy revulsion of feeling that had attended
the first breaking up of his domestic happiness, had
done injustice to her mind, to the sweetness of disposition
that had borne all his anger without retorting
in like manner. If Clifton was conscious of his own
quickness of temper, approaching to violence, he did
not for one moment suppose, that <span class='it'>he</span> was the cause
of any portion of the misery brooding over his daily
path. He attributed it all to the procrastinating spirit
of Lucy, and upon her head he laid the blame with
no unsparing hand. He forgot that she had numbered
twenty years, and was the mother of two children;
that her situation was one of exertion, and toil under
the most favorable circumstances; that he was
much her senior, had promised to cherish her tenderly.
Yet the first harsh word that dwelt on Lucy’s
heart was from the lips of her husband! How tenderly
in years long gone had she been nurtured!
The kind arm of a father had guided and guarded
her; the tender voice of a mother had lighted on her
path like sunshine—and now? Oh ye, who would
crush the spirit of the young and gentle, instead of
leading it tenderly by a straight path in the way of
wisdom—go down into the breaking heart and learn
its agony; its desolation, when the fine feelings of a
wasted nature go in upon the brain and consume it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning Clifton entered the nursery, “Lucy,”
he said; “my old classmate, and very dear friend
Walter Eustace is in town. He came unexpectedly;
his stay is short; I should like to ask him to spend
the day with me. Could you manage, love, to have
the time pass <span class='it'>comfortably</span> to my friend?” Lucy felt
all the meaning conveyed in the emphasis on a word
that from his lips sounded almost formidable in her
ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will do what I can,” she answered sadly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not scruple Lucy to get assistance. Have
every thing ready <span class='it'>in time</span>, and do not fail in having
order, and good arrangement. There was a time
Lucy, when Eustace heard much of you; I should be
gratified to think he found the wife worthy of the
praise the lover lavished so freely upon her. Sing
for us to-night—it is long since the piano was opened!—and
look, and smile as you once did, in the days
that are gone, but not forgotten Lucy.” His voice
softened unconsciously, he had gone back to that
early time, when love of Lucy absorbed every feeling
of his heart. He sighed; the stern, and bitter realities
of his life came with their heavy weight upon
him, and there was no balm in the future, for the
endurance of present evils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and left the room; Lucy’s eye followed
him, and as the door closed she murmured—“<span class='it'>not</span>
forgotten! Oh, Clifton how little reason I have to
believe you!” Lucy was absorbed in her own
thoughts so long as to be unconscious of the flight of
time. When she roused, she thought she would go
down stairs and see what was to be done, but her
little boy asked her some question, which she stopped
to answer; half an hour more elapsed before she got
to the kitchen. She told Betty she meant to hire a
cook for the morrow—thought she had better go at
once and engage one—yet, no, on second thoughts,
she might come with her to the parlors and assist
in arranging them; it would be quite time enough to
engage the cook when they were completed. To the
parlors they went, and Lucy was well satisfied with
the result of their labor—but mark her comment:
“What a great while we have been detained here;
well, I am sure I have meant this three weeks to
clean the parlors, but never could find time. If I
could but manage to attend them every day, they
would never get so out of order.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning came, the cook not engaged yet.
Betty was despatched in haste, but was unsuccessful—all
engaged for the day. So Betty must be trusted,
who sometimes did well, and at others signally failed.
Lucy spent the morning in the kitchen assisting
Betty and arranging every thing she could do, but
matters above were in the mean time sadly neglected,
her children dirty, and ill dressed, the
nursery in confusion, and Lucy almost bewildered
in deciding what had better be done, and what left
undone. She concluded to keep the children in the
nursery without changing their dress, and then hastened
to arrange her own, and go down stairs, as her
husband and his friend had by this time arrived. Her
face was flushed, and her countenance anxious; she
was conscious that Mr. Eustace noticed it, and her
uncomfortable feelings increased. The dinner, the
dinner—if it were only over! she thought a hundred
times. It came at last, and all other mortifications
were as nothing in comparison. There was not a
dish really well cooked, and every thing was served
up in a slovenly manner. Lucy’s cheeks tingled
with shame. Oh, if she had only sent <span class='it'>in time</span> for a
cook. It was her bitterest thought even then. When
the dinner was over Mr. Eustace asked for the
children, expressing a strong desire to see them.
Lucy colored, and in evident confusion, evaded the
request. Her husband was silent, having a suspicion
how matters stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then a great roar came from the hall, and the
oldest boy burst into the room. “Mother! mother!
Hannah shut me up she did!” A word from his
father silenced him, and Lucy took her dirty, ill
dressed boy by the hand and left the room. She
could not restrain her tears, but her keen sense of
right prevented her punishing the child, as she was
fully aware, had he been properly dressed, she would
not have objected to his presence, and that he was
only claiming an accorded privilege. Mr. Eustace
very soon left, and as soon as the door closed on him
Clifton thought: “I never can hope to see a friend
in comfort until I can afford to keep a house-keeper.
Was there ever such a curse in a man’s house as a
procrastinating spirit?” With such feelings it may
be supposed he could not meet his wife with any
degree of cordiality. Lucy said, “There was no help
for it, she had done her very best.” Clifton answered
her contemptuously; wearied and exhausted with
the fatigues of the day, she made no reply, but rose
up and retired to rest, glad to seek in sleep forgetfulness
of the weary life she led. Clifton had been unusually
irritated; when the morrow came, it still
manifested itself in many ways that bore hard on
Lucy; she did not reply to an angry word that fell
from his lips, but she felt none the less deeply. Some
misconduct in the child induced him to reflect with
bitterness on her maternal management. She drew
her hand over her eyes to keep back the tears, her
lip quivered, and her voice trembled as she uttered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not speak so harshly Clifton, if the fault is all
mine, most certainly the misery is also!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of what avail is it to speak otherwise?” he said
sternly, “you deserve wretchedness, and it is only
the sure result of your precious system.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever encourage me to reform, or point
out the way?” urged Lucy, gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I married a woman for a companion, not a child
to instruct her,” he answered bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay—but I was a child! happy—so happy in that
olden time, with all to love, and none to chide me.
A child, even in years, when you took me for a wife—too
soon a mother, shrinking from my responsibilities,
and without courage to meet my trials. I found
no sympathy to encourage me—no forbearance that
my years were few—no advice when most I needed
it—no tenderness when my heart was nearly breaking.
It is the first time, Clifton, I have reproached
you; but the worm will turn if it is trodden upon,”
and Lucy left the room. It was strange, even to
herself, that she had spoken so freely, yet it seemed
a sort of relief to the anguish of her heart. That
he had allowed her to depart without reply did not
surprise her; it may be doubted, although her heart
pined for it, if ever she expected tenderness from
Clifton more. It was perhaps an hour after her conversation
with Clifton, Lucy sat alone in the nursery;
her baby was asleep in the cradle beside her; they
were alone together, and as she gazed on its happy
face, she hoped with an humble hope, to rear it up,
that it might be enabled to <span class='it'>give</span> and receive happiness.
There was a slight rap at the door; she opened
it, and a glad cry escaped her,—“Uncle Joshua!”
she exclaimed. He took her in his arms for a moment,—that
kindly and excellent old man, while a
tear dimmed his eye as he witnessed her joy at seeing
him. She drew a stool towards him, and sat
down at his feet as she had often done before in her
happy, girlish days; she was glad when his hand
rested on her head, even as it had done in another
time; she felt a friend had come back to her, who
had her interest nearly at heart, who had loved her
long and most tenderly. Mr. Tremaine was the
brother of Lucy’s mother—he had arrived in town
unexpectedly; indeed had come chiefly with a view
of discovering the cause of Lucy’s low-spirited letters—he
feared all was not right, and as she was the
object of almost his sole earthly attachment, he could
not rest in peace while he believed her unhappy.
He was fast approaching three score years and ten;
never was there a warmer heart, a more incorruptible,
or sterling nature. Eccentric in many things,
possessing some prejudices, which inclined to ridicule
in himself, no man had sounder common sense,
or a more careful judgment. His hair was white,
and fell in long smooth locks over his shoulders; his
eye-brows were heavy, and shaded an eye as keen
and penetrating as though years had no power to
dim its light. The high, open brow, and the quiet
tenderness that dwelt in his smile, were the crowning
charms of a countenance on which nature had
stamped her seal as her “noblest work.” He spoke
to Lucy of other days, of the happy home from
whence he came, till her tears came down like
“summer rain,” with the mingling of sweet and bitter
recollections. Of her children next, and her eye
lighted, and her color came bright and joyous—the
warm feelings of a mother’s heart responded to every
word of praise he uttered. Of her husband—and
sadly “Uncle Joshua” noticed the change;—her
voice was low and desponding, and a look of sorrow
and care came back to the youthful face: “Clifton
was succeeding in business; she was gratified and
proud of his success,” and that was all she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Joshua’s” visit was of some duration. He
saw things as they really were, and the truth pained
him deeply. “Lucy,” he said quietly, as one day
they were alone together—“I have much to say,
and you to hear. Can you bear the truth, my dear
girl?” She was by his side in a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything from you, uncle. Tell me freely all
you think, and if it is censure of poor Lucy, little
doubt but that she will profit by it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a good girl!” said “Uncle Joshua,” resting
his hand on her head, “and you will be rewarded
yet.” He paused for a moment ere he said—“Lucy,
you are not a happy wife. You married with bright
prospects—who is to blame?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am—but not alone,” said Lucy, in a choking
voice, “not alone, there are some faults on both
sides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us first consider yours; Clifton’s faults will
not exonerate you from the performance of your duty.
For the love I bear you, Lucy, I will speak the truth:
all the misery of your wedded life proceeds from the
fatal indulgence of a procrastinating spirit. <span class='it'>One uncorrected
fault</span> has been the means of alienating
your husband’s affections, and bringing discord and
misrule into the very heart of your domestic Eden.
This must not be. You have strong sense and feeling,
and must conquer the defect of character that
weighs so heavily on your peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy burst into tears—“I fear I never can—and if
I do, Clifton will not thank me, or care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try, Lucy. You can have little knowledge of
the happiness it would bring or you would make the
effort. And Clifton will care. Bring order into his
household and comfort to his fireside, and he will
take you to his heart with a tenderer love than he
ever gave to the bride of his youth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy drew her breath gaspingly, and for a moment
gazed into her uncle’s face with something of
his own enthusiasm; but it passed and despondency
came with its withering train of tortures to frighten
her from exertion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You cannot think, dear uncle, how much I have
to do; and my children are so troublesome, that I
can never systematize time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us see first what you can do. What is your
first duty in the morning after you have dressed
yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To wash and dress my children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you always do it? Because if you rise early
you have time before breakfast. Your children are
happy and comfortable, only in your regular management
of every thing connected with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot always do it,” said Lucy, blushing—“sometimes
I get up as low-spirited and weary as
after the fatigues of the day. I have no heart to go
to work; Clifton is cold, and hurries off to business.
After breakfast I go through the house and to the
kitchen, so that it is often noon before I <span class='it'>can</span> manage
to dress them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now instead of all this, if you were to rise
early, dress your little ones before breakfast, arrange
your work, and go regularly from one work to the
other; <span class='it'>never</span> putting off one to finish another, you
would get through everything, and have time to
walk—that each day may have its necessary portion
of exercise in the open air. That would dissipate
weariness, raise your spirits, and invigorate your
frame. Lucy, will you not make the trial for Clifton’s
sake? Make his home a well-ordered one, and
he will be glad to come into it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Lucy promised to think of it. But her uncle
was surprised at her apparent apathy, and not long
in divining the true reason. Her heart is not in it, he
thought, and if her husband don’t rouse it, never
will be. Lucy felt she was an object of indifference,
if not dislike to Clifton; there was no end to be accomplished
by self-exertion; and as there was nothing
to repay her for the wasted love of many years,
she would encourage no new hopes to find them as
false as the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Joshua” sat together with Dr. Clifton, in
the office of the latter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has it ever struck you, Doctor, how much Lucy
is altered of late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot say that I see any particular alteration.
It is some time since you saw her;—matrimony is
not very favorable to good looks, and may have diminished
her beauty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not of her beauty I speak. Her character
is wholly changed; her spirits depressed, and her
energies gone,” and “Uncle Joshua” spoke warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never thought her particularly energetic,” said
the Doctor, dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one would suppose, my good sir, you had
ever thought, or cared much about her.” “Uncle
Joshua” was angry; but the red spot left his cheek
as soon as it came there as he went on:—“Let us
speak in kindness of this sad business. I see Lucy
was in the right in thinking you had lost all affection
for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Lucy say that? I should be sorry she
thought so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man has cause for sorrow, when a wife fully
believes his love for her is gone. Nothing can be
more disheartening—nothing hardens the heart more
fearfully, and sad indeed is the lot of that woman
who bears the evils of matrimony without the happiness
that often counterbalances them. We, who are
of harder natures, have too little sympathy, perhaps
too little thought for her peculiar trials.” Gently
then, as a father to an only son, the old man related
to Clifton all that had passed between Lucy and himself.
More than once he saw his eyes moisten and
strong emotion manifest itself in his manly countenance.
A something of remorseful sorrow filled his
heart, and its shadow lay on his face. “Uncle
Joshua” read aright the expression, and his honest
heart beat with joy at the prospects he thought it
opened before them. Always wise-judging he said
nothing further, but left him to his own reflections.
And Clifton did indeed reflect long and anxiously:
he saw indeed how much his own conduct had discouraged
his wife, while it had been a source of
positive unhappiness to her. He went at length to
seek her;—she was alone in the parlor reading, or
rather a book was before her, from which her eyes
often wandered, until her head sank on the arm of
the sofa, and a heavy sigh came sadly on the ear of
Clifton. “Lucy, dear Lucy, grieve no more! We
have both been wrong, but I have erred the most—having
years on my side and experience. Shall we
not forgive each other, my sweet wife?” and he
lifted her tenderly in his arms, and kissed the tears
as they fell on her cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have caused you much suffering, Lucy, I greatly
fear;—your faults occasioned me only inconvenience.
Dry up your tears, and let me hear that you forgive
me, Lucy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have nothing to forgive,” exclaimed Lucy.
“Oh, I have been wrong, very wrong!—but if you
had only encouraged me to reform, and sustained
and aided me in my efforts to do so by your affection,
so many of our married days would not have passed
in sorrow and suffering.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I feel they would not,” said Clifton, moved
almost to tears. “Now, Lucy, the self-exertion shall
be mutual. I will never rest until I correct the
violence of temper, that has caused you so much
pain. You have but one fault, procrastination—will
you strive also to overcome it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will,” said Lucy; “but you must be very patient
with me, and rather encourage me to new exertions.
I have depended too long on your looks
not to be influenced by them still—my love, Clifton,
stronger than your own, fed on the memory of our
early happiness, until my heart grew sick that it
would never return. Oh! if you could love me as
you did then, could respect me as once you did, I
feel I could make any exertion to deserve it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will you not be more worthy of esteem and
love than ever you were, dear Lucy, if you succeed
in reforming yourself! I believe you capable of the
effort; and if success attends it, the blessing will
fall on us both, Lucy, and on our own dear children.
Of one thing be assured, that my love will know no
further change or diminution. You shall not have
cause to complain of me again, Lucy. Now smile
on me, dearest, as you once did in a time we will
never forget—and tell me you will be happy for my
sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy smiled, and gave the assurance—her heart
beat lightly in her bosom—the color spread over her
face—her eyes sparkled with the new, glad feelings
of hope and happiness, and as Clifton clasped her
in his arms, he thought her more beautiful than in
that early time when he had first won her love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that very hour Lucy began her work of reform;
it seemed as though new life had been infused into
her hitherto drooping frame. She warbled many a
sweet note of her youth, long since forgotten, for
her spirits seemed running over from very excess of
happiness. “Uncle Joshua” was consulted in all
her arrangements, and of great use he was:—he
planned for her, encouraged her, made all easy by
his method and management. She had gone to work
with a strong wish to do her duty, and with a husband’s
love shining steadily on her path, a husband’s
affection for all success, and sympathy with every
failure, there was little fear of her not succeeding.
’Tis true, the habit had been long in forming, but
every link she broke in the chain that bound her,
brought a new comfort to that happy household
hearth. Clifton had insisted on hiring a woman to
take charge of the children—this was a great relief.
And somehow or other, “Uncle Joshua” looked up
a good cook.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said Lucy, “to fail would be a positive
disgrace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No danger of your failing, my sweet wife,” said
Clifton, with a glance of affection that might have
satisfied even her heart. “You are already beyond
the fear of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lucy shook her head—“I must watch or my old
enemy will be back again before I am fully rid of
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is right to watch ourselves, I know, Lucy; are
you satisfied that I have done so, and have, in some
measure, corrected myself?” said Clifton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never seen a frown on your face since
you promised me to be patient. You have been, and
will continue to be, I am sure,” said Lucy, fondly,
as she raised his hand to her lips which had rested
on her arm. They were happy both, and whatever
trouble was in store for them in their future life,
they had strong mutual affection to sustain them
under it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless them both,” murmured “Uncle
Joshua,” as he drew his hand hard across his eyes
after witnessing this little scene. “I have done good
here, but in many a case I might be termed a meddling
old fool, and not without reason, perhaps. ’Tis
a pity though, that folks, who will get their necks
into this matrimonial yoke, would not try to make
smooth the uneven places, instead of stumbling all
the way, breaking their hearts by way of amusement,
as they go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that you say, ‘Uncle Joshua?’ ” said
Lucy, turning quickly round, and walking towards
him, accompanied by her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a bad habit of talking aloud,” said he,
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I thought you were abusing matrimony,
uncle—you surely were not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cannot say exactly what I was thinking aloud. I
am an old bachelor, Lucy, and have few objects of
affection in the world: you have been to me as a
child, always a good child, Lucy, too—and now I
think you will make a good wife, and find the happiness
you so well deserve. Am I right, love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you are, uncle. If it had not been for
your kindness though, I might never have been happy
again,” and tears dimmed Lucy’s eyes at the recollection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall not forget your kindness,” said Clifton
as he extended his hand, which “Uncle Joshua”
grasped warmly. “I wish every married pair in
trouble could find a good genius like yourself to interfere
in their favor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten to one he would be kicked out of doors!”
said the old man, laughing. “This matrimony is a
queer thing—those who have their necks in the noose
had better make the most of it—and those out of the
scrape keep so. Ah! you little reprobate!” he cried
as he caught Lucy’s bright eye, and disbelieving
shake of the head—“you don’t pretend to contradict
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes I do, with my whole heart too. I would not
give up my husband for the wide world, nor he his
Lucy for the fairest girl in America!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” exclaimed Clifton—“you are dearer to
me than any other human being!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“W-h-e-w!!” was “Uncle Joshua’s” reply, in a
prolonged sort of whistle, while his eyes opened in
the profoundest wonder, and his whole countenance
was expressive of the most ludicrous astonishment—“w-h-e-w!!”</p>

<p class='line0'>And deadliest offspring of deep ire⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;E’er flashed across my tortured brain:</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet! yet there is a something here</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of hideous vacancy and fear,</p>
<p class='line0'>(Not fear which cowards merely feel,</p>
<p class='line0'>Who hear the damnèd’s thunder peal,)</p>
<p class='line0'>A trembling—which the brave confess</p>
<p class='line0'>In this their last and worst distress⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Part of the soul it burns a spell,</p>
<p class='line0'>And like her indestructible⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Which only those who feel <span class='it'>that</span> woe,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Brought by an unrepented deed,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Amid the spirit’s stagnant air⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>More fearful than the damn’d one’s tomb</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Oh! God why was I chos’n for such?</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I who until that fearful hour⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Ah! would not e’en too wildly touch</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The summer’s very humblest flower.</p>
<p class='line0'>The little bird whose rain-bow wing</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I saw, in spring time’s roseate eves,</p>
<p class='line0'>With its own beauty quivering</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Amid the golden orange leaves,</p>
<p class='line0'>I made a friend—as if for me</p>

<p class='line0'>The deadly spider weave his pall,</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The minstrel-breeze which struck by hours</p>

<p class='line0'>The sullen thunder whose red eyes</p>
<p class='line0'>Flashed angrily within our skies⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>All! all to me were but the chain</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Along whose wond’rous links there came</p>
<p class='line0'>Unceasingly to head and brain</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Love’s own electric flame.</p>
<p class='line0'>Yes! when the Harp of Nature roll’d</p>
<p class='line0'>Its midnight hymn from chords of gold,</p>
<p class='line0'>And awful silence seemed to own,</p>
<p class='line0'>Throughout the world, its wizard tone,</p>
<p class='line0'>I’ve stood and wildly wished to float</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Into that music’s liquid strain⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh! heavenly as its sweetest note⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Nor ever walk the earth again.</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The <span class='sc'>Best</span> can only feel the fire,</p>

<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;That strikes the mystic march of Time.</p>
<p class='line0'>The tree of most luxuriant stem</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I was my father’s only child⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;(The cherished scion of a race</p>

<p class='line0'>I need not tell how oft he smiled</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;When counting o’er to me each deed,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In gallant barque, on champing steed,</p>
<p class='line0'>Of ancestors in battle wild;</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor how he gazed upon my face</p>
<p class='line0'>And there by hours would fondly trace</p>
<p class='line0'>The lines which as they manlier grew,</p>
<p class='line0'>He deemed the signs of Glory, too.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I saw at last the sable pall</p>
<p class='line0'>Gloom in our lordly castle’s hall,</p>
<p class='line0'>And heard the Friar’s burial rite</p>
<p class='line0'>Keeping the watches of the night.</p>
<p class='line0'>Another noble form was laid</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Where Lorro’s dead together meet⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>And I, in ducal robes arrayed,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Took Lorro’s castled seat.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I need not tell how passed the days,</p>
<p class='line0'>I need not tell of pleasure’s ways⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Where bright-eyed mirth flung dewy flowers</p>
<p class='line0'>Beneath the silver-feet of hours,</p>
<p class='line0'>While Time himself o’er music’s strings</p>
<p class='line0'>Lean’d panting on his weary wings.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>At last there came unto our gate</p>
<p class='line0'>One looking worn and desolate,</p>
<p class='line0'>Who asked compassion for his fate.</p>
<p class='line0'>He said he was an orphan lad;</p>
<p class='line0'>In sooth my lonely heart was glad⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>For I was weary of my state</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Where only courtiers crowded round;</p>
<p class='line0'>I wished some fair and gentle mate,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And such I fondly hoped I found.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Months rolled away and still he grew,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Beneath my care a lovely boy</p>
<p class='line0'>And day by day I found anew</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In him a very father’s joy.⁠—</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And eighteen summers now have died</p>
<p class='line0'>Since thou cam’st here my own heart’s pride:</p>
<p class='line0'>And still thy voice of silver seems</p>
<p class='line0'>Sweet as sweet music heard in dreams;</p>
<p class='line0'>And still thy softly radiant eye</p>
<p class='line0'>Looks innocent as yonder sky,</p>
<p class='line0'>And all as fair—when rainbows rest</p>
<p class='line0'>Like angel-plumes upon its breast;</p>
<p class='line0'>And still thy soul seems richly set</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Within its form, like some bright gem</p>
<p class='line0'>Which might by worshippers be met</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In Purity’s own diadem.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>In Lorro’s hall the tone of lutes</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And harp is wafted through the air,</p>
<p class='line0'>Such as the glad most fitly suits</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;When mirth and rosy wine are there.</p>
<p class='line0'>In Lorro’s castle, wreathed in light</p>
<p class='line0'>And flowers, I ween a holy rite,</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And who art thou around whose brow</p>

<p class='line0'>Thus standing there so radiantly?⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>With bright curls floating on the air</p>
<p class='line0'>And glorious as the cherubs wear;</p>
<p class='line0'>An eye where love and virtue beam</p>
<p class='line0'>Like spirits of an Angel’s dream!</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Away! away! thou maddening sight!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Away! what dost thou, Laura, here?</p>
<p class='line0'>Thus standing by my side to-night,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And long since in thy sepulchre?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>What! will the grave its events tell?</p>
<p class='line0'>The iron tomb dissolve its spell?</p>
<p class='line0'>It has! it has! And there she stands</p>
<p class='line0'>Mocking me with her outstretched hands;</p>
<p class='line0'>And oft her icy fingers press</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;My hot brow through the long, long night;</p>
<p class='line0'>And voices as of deep distress,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Like prisoned wind, whose wailing sound</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Seems madly struggling under ground,</p>
<p class='line0'>Peal dirge-like on my ear: away!</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor wait, oh! horrid shape, for day</p>
<p class='line0'>Such as these gloomy realms display⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;E’er thou shalt quit my tortured sight.⁠—</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And we were wed! I need not say</p>
<p class='line0'>How heavenly came and went each day,</p>
<p class='line0'>Enough! our souls together beat</p>
<p class='line0'>Like two sweet tunes that wandering meet,</p>
<p class='line0'>Then so harmoniously they run</p>
<p class='line0'>The hearer deems they are but one.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>There are mailed forms in Lorro’s halls,</p>
<p class='line0'>And rustling banners on its walls,</p>
<p class='line0'>And nodding plumes o’er many a brow,</p>
<p class='line0'>That moulders on the red field now.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The wave of battle swells around!</p>
<p class='line0'>Shall Lorro’s chieftain thus be found</p>
<p class='line0'>In revelry or idlesse bound,</p>
<p class='line0'>When Glory hangs her blood-red sign</p>
<p class='line0'>Above the castellated Rhine?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Away! away, I flew in pride</p>
<p class='line0'>With those who mustered by my side:</p>
<p class='line0'>But not, I ween, did Lorro miss</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The ruler from its ducal throne,</p>
<p class='line0'>’Till many a wild and burning kiss</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Of woman’s sweet lips warmed his own.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And Julio, too, (for such the name</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I gave the orphan boy,) with tears</p>
<p class='line0'>And choking sob, and trembling came</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To whisper me his rising fears.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>That I his father—I whose love</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Had sheltered long his feeble form</p>
<p class='line0'>E’en as some stronger bird the dove</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;All mateless wandering in the storm,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>That I borne down amid the stern</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And bloody shapes of battle wild,</p>
<p class='line0'>Would never from its wreck return</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To sooth his lonely orphan child;</p>
<p class='line0'>And then on bended knees he prayed⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;(God! why availed not his prayer?)</p>
<p class='line0'>That I would give him steed and blade,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;So he might in my dangers share.</p>
<p class='line0'>I left him for I could not bare</p>
<p class='line0'>That tender brow to war’s wild air.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Away! away on foaming steed,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;For two long years my sword was out;</p>
<p class='line0'>And I had learned (a soldier’s need,)</p>
<p class='line0'>—Almost without a groan to bleed⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Aye! gloried in the battle’s shout;</p>
<p class='line0'>For it gave presage of a fame</p>
<p class='line0'>Such as the brave alone may claim.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>For two long years, as I have told,</p>
<p class='line0'>The storm of war around me roll’d;</p>
<p class='line0'>But never more, by day or night</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In sunshine or in shower,</p>
<p class='line0'>Did I forget my castle’s light⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Love’s only idol-flower!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>There is a deeper passion known</p>
<p class='line0'>For those in love, when left alone;</p>
<p class='line0'>Then busy fancy ponders o’er</p>
<p class='line0'>Some kindness never prized before:</p>
<p class='line0'>And we can almost turn with tears</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And deep upbraiding (as distress</p>
<p class='line0'>Comes with the holy light of years)</p>
<p class='line0'>And kneeling ask forgiveness.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And so I felt—and Laura beamed</p>
<p class='line0'>Still lovelier than she ever seemed,</p>
<p class='line0'>E’en when the dew of childhood’s hours</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Along her heart’s first blossoms clung,</p>
<p class='line0'>And I amid my native bowers</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In sinless worship o’er them hung.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Oh! are not feelings such as these</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Like splendid rainbow-glories caught</p>
<p class='line0'>(To cheer our voyage o’er life’s seas)</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;From Heaven’s own holy <span class='sc'>Land of Thought</span>?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And yet, oh, God! how soon may they</p>
<p class='line0'>Like those bright glories flee away,</p>
<p class='line0'>And leave the heart an unlit sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Where piloted by dark despair</p>
<p class='line0'>The spirit-wreck rolls fearfully</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Within the night of sullen air?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>At last the eye of battle closed⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Its lurid fires no longer burned⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>The warrior on his wreath reposed,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And I unto my halls returned.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Oh! who can tell the joys that start</p>
<p class='line0'>Like angel-wings within the heart,</p>
<p class='line0'>When wearied with war’s toil, the chief</p>
<p class='line0'>In home’s dear light would seek relief!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Not he who has no loved one there</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Left in his absence lonely⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Whose heart he fondly hopes shall beat</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;For him and for him only.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And such my Laura’s heart I deemed;</p>
<p class='line0'>For me alone I thought she beamed</p>
<p class='line0'>Like some pure lamp on hermit’s shrine,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which only glows for him, divine</p>
<p class='line0'>And beauteous as the spirit-eyes</p>
<p class='line0'>That light the bow’rs of Paradise.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>It was a lovely eve, but known</p>
<p class='line0'>Unto the South’s voluptuous zone;</p>
<p class='line0'>An eve whose shining vesture hung</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Like Heaven’s own rosy flags unfurl’d,</p>
<p class='line0'>And by some star-eyed cherub flung</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In sport around our gloomy world;</p>
<p class='line0'>An eve in which the coldest frame</p>
<p class='line0'>And heart must feel a warming flame,</p>
<p class='line0'>When light and soul no longer single,</p>
<p class='line0'>But in a bridal glory mingle:</p>
<p class='line0'>Then think how I whose spirit bowed</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Whene’er the dimmest light was sent</p>
<p class='line0'>From twinkling star or rosy cloud</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In God’s blue, glorious firmament⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>How I in that ethereal time,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Standing beside my native rill</p>
<p class='line0'>And shadowed by such hues sublime,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Felt unseen lightning through me thrill.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I stood within my own domain⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Once more upon my birth-right soil,</p>
<p class='line0'>Free’d from the gory battle-plain</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And weary with its toil.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Laura!” my step is in the hall!</p>
<p class='line0'>My sword suspended on the wall!</p>
<p class='line0'>My standard-sheet once more uprolled</p>
<p class='line0'>Where it has lain for years untold!</p>
<p class='line0'>“Laura!”—In vain I stood for her</p>
<p class='line0'>To meet the long-lost worshipper.</p>
<p class='line0'>“Ho, Julio!” What? No answer yet?</p>
<p class='line0'>It rung from base to parapet!</p>
<p class='line0'>I mounted up the marble stair!⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I rushed into the olden room!</p>
<p class='line0'>It shone beneath the evening’s glare</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;As silent as the tomb,⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>Save that a slave with wond’ring eye</p>
<p class='line0'>Looked from the dreary vacancy.</p>
<p class='line0'>“Your Lady, Serf?”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“She’s in the bower.”</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;“In sooth I should have sought her there!”</p>
<p class='line0'>For oft we passed the twilight hour</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In its delicious air.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I rushed with lightning steps—Oh, God!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Why flashed not then thy blasting flame⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>That it might wither from the sod</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The one who madly called Thy name?</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>My poniard grasped, left not its sheath⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>I had nor hope—nor life—nor breath;</p>
<p class='line0'>I only felt the ice of death</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Slowly congealing o’er my heart⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>And on my eye a dizzy cloud</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Swam round and round, a sickening part</p>
<p class='line0'>Of that which seemed a closing shroud</p>
<p class='line0'>The one might feel whom burial gave</p>
<p class='line0'>All prematurely to the grave.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But soon that deadly trance was o’er;</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The foliage hid as yet; and I</p>
<p class='line0'>Retraced the path I trod before</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;With such a heart-wild ecstasy.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>For as I gazed upon their guilt,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A thought flashed out of demon-hue;</p>
<p class='line0'>And I resigned my dagger’s hilt</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;As deadlier then my vengeance grew.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Small torture satisfies the <span class='it'>weak</span>⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;For they but slightly feel a wrong;</p>
<p class='line0'>I would by hours my vengeance wreak!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The deep revenge is for the <span class='it'>strong</span>.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>In Lorro’s castle is a cell</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;(Where Cruelty has sat in state,</p>
<p class='line0'>I ween that some have known it well,)</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Which is divided by a grate.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>No sunbeam ever pierced its night;</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor aught save lamp there shed its light;</p>
<p class='line0'>No sound save sound of wild despair</p>
<p class='line0'>Hath ever vexed its heavy air.</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon its walls so grim and old</p>
<p class='line0'>Have gathered centuries of mould.</p>
<p class='line0'>It seems that with the birth of time</p>
<p class='line0'>That cell was hollowed out by crime,</p>
<p class='line0'>And there, her hateful labor o’er,</p>
<p class='line0'>She took her first sweet draught of gore.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Ha! Ha! I see them! See them now⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>The cold damp dripping from each brow,</p>
<p class='line0'>With hands oustretched they mercy sue⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>(Ye know not how my vengeance grew,)</p>
<p class='line0'>While I stood by with sullen smile⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The only answer to their grief⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>For wearied in that dungeon aisle,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In smiles <span class='it'>I</span> even found relief.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I watched them in that dreary gloom,</p>
<p class='line0'>(To me a heaven—to them a tomb,)</p>
<p class='line0'>For hours—for days—and joyed to hear</p>
<p class='line0'>Their pleadings fill that sepulchre.</p>
<p class='line0'>At first they tried to lull their state</p>
<p class='line0'>By cheering each thro’ that dull grate,</p>
<p class='line0'>(For this they lingered separate;</p>
<p class='line0'>I could not bear e’en then to see</p>
<p class='line0'>Them closer in their agony.)</p>
<p class='line0'>And this they did for days! at last</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;A change upon them came⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>For each to each reproaches cast,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;In which I heard my name.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>I spake no word—their dread replies</p>
<p class='line0'>Were only read within my eyes,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which as they glared upon the pair,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Like scorpions writhing in their pain</p>
<p class='line0'>When wounded in the loathsome lair,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Seemed burning to my very brain.</p>
<p class='line0'>I shall not tell how hunger grew</p>
<p class='line0'>In that dread time upon the two⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>When each would vainly try to break</p>
<p class='line0'>The bars an earthquake scarce could shake.</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor how they gnawed, in their great pain,</p>
<p class='line0'>Their dungeon’s rusted iron chain;</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor how their curses, deep and oft,</p>
<p class='line0'>From parching lips were rung aloft;</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor how like babbling fiends they would</p>
<p class='line0'>Together vex the solitude;</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor how the wasting crimson tide</p>
<p class='line0'>Of withered life their wants supplied;</p>
<p class='line0'>Nor how—enough! enough they died</p>
<p class='line0'>Aye! and I saw the red worm creep</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon their slumbers, dark and deep,</p>
<p class='line0'>And felt with more of joy than dread</p>
<p class='line0'>The grim eyes of the fleshless dead.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Long years have passed away, since then</p>
<p class='line0'>And I have mixed with fellow men;</p>
<p class='line0'>On land and wave my flag unfurl’d</p>

<p class='line0'>For Lorro was a soldier born;</p>
<p class='line0'>His music was the battle-horn.</p>
<p class='line0'>E’en when a boy—his playthings were</p>
<p class='line0'>Such deadly toys as sword and spear.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;I did not pant for fame or blood,</p>
<p class='line0'>But thus in agony I sought</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;To strangle in their birth the brood</p>
<p class='line0'>Of serpents cradled in my thought.</p>
<p class='line0'>I’ve tried to pray: In vain! In vain!</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The very words seem brands of fire</p>
<p class='line0'>By demons hurled into my brain⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;The burning ministers of ire.</p>

</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>How <span class='sc'>Spirit</span>, mid such fearful strife</p>
<p class='line0'>I left the hated mortal life,</p>
<p class='line0'>I need not say; it matters not</p>
<p class='line0'>How we may break that earthly spell;</p>
<p class='line0'>Enough! enough! I knew my lot</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;And feel its agony too well.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>My frame beside its father rests⁠—</p>
<p class='line0'>The same old banner o’er their breasts</p>
<p class='line0'>Which they with all their serfs, of yore,</p>
<p class='line0'>To battle and to triumph bore.</p>
<p class='line0'>No chieftain sways the castle’s wall,</p>
<p class='line0'>No chieftain revels in its hall.</p>
<p class='line0'>And on each bastion’s leaning stone</p>
<p class='line0'>Grim desolation sits alone,</p>
<p class='line0'>While organ winds their masses roll</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Around each lonely turret’s head,</p>
<p class='line0'>And seem to chant, “<span class='sc'>Rest troubled soul!</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY W. W. STORY.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the latter part of the autumn in Berlin there
are usually some fine days. The cloudless sun shines
pleasantly out and evaporates the moisture from the
warm air which blows through the streets. Mingling
together in motley groups, you may see a long row
of fashionables, citizens with their wives, little children
in Sunday clothes, priests, Jewesses, young
counsellors, professors, milliners, dancers, officers,
&amp;c. walking among the lindens in the Park. All the
seats in Klaus &amp; Weber’s coffee-house are soon
occupied; the coffee throws off its steam. The
fashionables light their cigars; everywhere persons
are talking; here an argument is going on about war
and peace, there about Madame Bethman’s shoes,
whether the last ones she wore were green or gray,
or about the state of the market and the bad money,
&amp;c., until all is hushed by an Aria from “Tanchon,”
with which an untuned harp, a pair of ill-tuned
violins, a wheezing flute, and a spasmodic bassoon
torment themselves and their audience. Upon the
balustrade which separates Weber’s place from the
high-way, several little round tables and garden
chairs are placed; here one can breathe in the free
air and observe the comers and goers, at a distance
from the monotonous noises of the accursed orchestra.
There I sat down, and, abandoning myself to
the light play of my fancy, conversed with the imaginary
forms of friends who came around me, upon
science and art, and all that is dearest to man. The
mass of promenaders passing by me grows more
and more motley, but nothing disturbs me, nothing
can drive away my imaginary company. Now the
execrable Trio of an intolerable waltz draws me out
of my world of dreams. The high, squeaking tones
of the violins and flutes, and the growling ground
bass of the bassoon are all that I can hear; they
follow each other up and down in octaves, which
tear the ear, until, at last, like one who is seized with
a burning pain, I cry out involuntarily,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What mad music! Those detestable octaves!”—Near
me some one mutters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cursed Fate! Here is another octave-hunter!”
I look up and perceive now for the first time that
imperceptibly to me a man has taken a place at the
same table, who is looking intently at me, and from
whom I cannot take my eyes away again. Never
did I see any head or figure which made so sudden
and powerful an impression upon me. A slightly
crooked nose was joined to a broad open brow, with
remarkable prominences over the bushy, half-gray
eyebrows, under which the eyes glanced forth with
an almost wild, youthful fire, (the age of the man
might be about fifty;) the white and well-formed
chin presented a singular contrast to the compressed
mouth, and a satirical smile breaking out in the
curious play of muscles in the hollow cheeks,
seemed to contradict the deep melancholy earnestness
which rested upon the brow; a few gray locks
of hair lay behind the ears, which were large and
prominent; over the tall, slender figure was wrapped
a large modern overcoat. As soon as I looked
at the man he cast down his eyes and gave his whole
attention to the occupation from which my outcry
had probably aroused him. He was shaking, with
apparent delight, some snuff from several little paper
horns into a large box which stood before him, and
moistening it with red wine from a quarter-flask.
The music had ceased and I felt an irresistible desire
to address him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad that the music is over,” said I, “it was
really intolerable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man threw a hasty glance at me and shook
out the contents from the last paper horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be better not to play at all,” I began
again, “Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think at all about it,” said he, “you are a
musician and connoisseur by profession”⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wrong, I am neither. I once took lessons
upon the harpsichord and in thorough-bass, because
I considered it something which was necessary
to a good education, and among other things
I was told that nothing produced a more disagreeable
effect than when the bass follows the upper
notes in octaves. At first I took this upon authority,
and have ever since found it to be a fact.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really?” interrupted he, and stood up and strode
thoughtfully towards the musicians, often casting his
eyes upwards and striking upon his brow with the
palm of his hand, as if he wished to awaken some
particular remembrance. I saw him speak to the
musicians whom he treated with a dignified air of
command—He returned and scarcely had he regained
his seat, before they began to play the overture
to “Iphigenia in Aulis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With his eyes half-closed and his folded arms
resting on the table he listened to the Andante; all
the while slightly moving his foot to indicate the
falling in of the different parts; now he reversed his
head—threw a swift glance about him—the left hand,
with fingers apart, resting upon the table, as though
he were striking a chord upon the Piano Forte, and
the right raised in the air; he was certainly the
conductor who was indicating to the orchestra the
entrance of the various Tempos—The right hand
falls and the Allegro begins—a burning blush flew
over his pale cheeks; his eyebrows were raised and
drawn together; upon his wrinkled brow an inward
rage flashed through his bold eyes, with a fire, which
by degrees changed into a smile that gathered about
his half-open mouth. Now he leaned back again,
his eyebrows were drawn up, the play of muscles
again swept over his face, his eyes glanced, the
deep internal pain was dissolved in a delight which
seized and vehemently agitated every fibre of his
frame—he heaved a deep sigh, and drops stood upon
his brow. He now indicated the entrance of the
Tutti and the other principal parts; his right hand
never ceased beating the time, and with his left he
drew a handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped his
face—Thus he animated with flesh and color the
skeleton of the Overture, formed by the two violins.
I heard the soft plaintive lament breathed out by the
flutes, after the storm of the violins and basses died
away, and the thunder of the kettle drums had
ceased; I heard the lightly touched tones of the
violoncello and the bassoon, which fill the heart
with irrepressible yearning—again the Tutti enters
treading along the unison like a towering huge giant
and the hollow lamenting expires beneath his crushing
footsteps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The overture was finished; the man suffered both
his arms to drop, and sat with closed eyes, like one
who was exhausted by excessive exertion. This
bottle was empty; I filled his glass with the Burgundy,
which in the meantime I had procured. He
heaved a deep sigh, and seemed to awaken out of
his dream. I motioned him to drink; he did so without
hesitation, and swallowing the contents of the
glass at one draught, exclaimed,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am well pleased with the performance! The
orchestra did bravely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet,” added I, “yet it was only a feeble outline
of a master-piece finished in living colors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I right? You are not a Berliner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly right; I only reside here occasionally.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Burgundy is good; but it is growing cold
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us go into the house and finish the flask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good proposal—I do not know you; neither
do you know me. We will not ask each other’s
names. Names are sometimes in the way. Here am
I drinking Burgundy without it costing me anything.
Our companionship is agreeable to both, and so far
so good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this he said with good-humored frankness. We
entered the house together. As soon as he sat down
and threw open his overcoat, I perceived with
astonishment, that under it he wore an embroidered
vest with long lappels, black velvet breeches, and a
very small silver-hilted dagger. He again buttoned
up his coat carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you ask me if I was a Berliner?” I
resumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because in such a case it would be necessary for
me to leave you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds like a riddle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in the least, when I tell you that I—that I am
a composer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no idea of your meaning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well then excuse me for my exclamation just
now. I see that you understand yourself thoroughly
and nothing of Berlin and Berliners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose and walked once hastily up and down;
then went to the window, and in a scarcely audible
voice hummed the chorus of Priestesses from the
Iphigenia in Tauris, while at intervals he struck
upon the window at the entrance of the Tutti. To
my great astonishment I observed that he made
several modifications of the melody, which struck
me with their power and originality. I let him go on
without interruption. He finished and returned to
his seat. Surprised by the extraordinary bearing of
the man, and by this fantastic expression of his
singular musical talent—I remained silent. After
some time he began⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you never composed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I have made some attempts in the art;
only I found that all which seemed to me to have
been written at inspired moments, became afterwards
flat and tedious; so that I let it alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have done wrong: for the mere fact of your
having made the attempt is no small proof of your
talent. We learn music when we are children, because
papa and mamma will have it so; now you
go to work jingling and fiddling, but imperceptibly
the mind becomes susceptible to music. Perhaps the
half-forgotten theme of the little song, which you
formerly sang, was the first original thought, and
from this embryo, nourished laboriously by foreign
powers, grows a giant, who consumes all within
his reach, and changes all into his own flesh and
blood! Ah, how is it possible to point out the innumerable
influences which lead a man to compose.
There is a broad high-way, where all are hurrying
round and shouting and screaming; we are the
initiated! we are at the goal! Only through the
ivory door is there entrance to the land of dreams;
few ever see the door and still fewer pass through
it. All seems strange here. Wild forms move hither
and thither and each has a certain character—one
more than the others. They are never seen in the
high-way; they only can be found behind the ivory
door. It is difficult to come out of this kingdom.
Monsters besiege the way as before the Castle of
Alsinens—they twirl—they twist. Many dream their
dream in the Kingdom of Dreams,—they dissolve in
dreams,—they cast no more shadows—otherwise by
means of their shadows they would perceive the
rays which pass through this realm; only a few
awakened out of this dream, walk about and stride
through the Kingdom of Dreams—they come to
Truth. This is the highest moment;—the union with
the eternal and unspeakable! It is the triple tone,
from which the accords, like stars, shoot down and
spin around you with threads of fire. You lie there
like a chrysalis in the fire, until the Psyche soars
up to the sun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke these last words, he sprang up, and
raised his eyes, and threw up his hand. Then he
seated himself and quickly emptied the full glass. A
silence ensued, which I would not break, through a
fear of leading this extraordinary man out of his
track. At last he continued in a calmer manner⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was in the kingdom of dreams a thousand
pangs and sorrows tormented me. It was night,
and the grinning forms of monsters rushed in upon
me, now dragging me down into the abyss of the
sea, and now lifting me high into the air. Rays of
light streamed through the night, and these rays
were tones which encircled me with delicious
clearness. I awoke out of my pain and saw a large
clear eye, gazing into an organ, and while it gazed,
tones issued forth and sparkled and intervened in
chords more glorious than I had ever imagined. Up
and down streamed melodies, and as I swam in this
stream, and was on the point of sinking, the eye
looked down upon me and raised me out of the roaring
waves. It was night again. Two colossi in
glittering harnesses stepped up to me—Tonic and
fifth! they lifted me up but the eye smiled; I know
what fills thy breast with yearnings, the gentle tender
third will step between the colossi; you will
hear his sweet voice, will see me again, and my
melodies shall become yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you saw the eye again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I saw it again. Long years I sighed in the
realms of dreams—there—yes, there!—I sat in a
beautiful valley, and listened to the flowers as they
sang together; only one sun-flower was silent and
sadly bent its closed chalice towards the earth. Invisible
bonds bound me to it—it raised its head. The
chalice opened, and streaming out of it again the eye
met mine—The tones, like rays of light, drew my
head toward the flower which eagerly enclosed it.
Larger and larger grew the leaves—flames streamed
forth from it—they flowed around me—the eye had
vanished and I was in the chalice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke these last words, he sprang up, and
rushed out of the room with rapid youthful strides.
I awaited his return in vain; I concluded at last to
go down into the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I approached the Brandenburg gates, I saw in
the gloaming a tall figure stride by me, which I immediately
recognized as my strange companion—I
said to him⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you leave me so abruptly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was too late and the Euphon began to sound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what you mean!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the worse: for I should like to understand
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you hear nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is past! Let us go—I do not generally like
company; but—you are not a composer—you are
not a Berliner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot conceive what so prejudices you against
the Berliners. Here, where art is so highly esteemed
and practised by the people in the highest degree—I
should think that a man of your genius in art would
like to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mistaken. I am condemned for my
torment to wander about here in this deserted place
like a departed spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here in Berlin—a deserted place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it is deserted to me, for I can find no kindred
spirit here. I am alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the artists!—the composers!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Away with them. They criticise and criticise,
refining away everything to find one poor little
thought—but beyond their babble about art and artistical
taste, and I know not what—they can shape
out nothing, and as soon as they endeavor to bring
out a few thoughts into daylight—their fearful coldness
shows their extreme distance from the sun—it
is Lapland work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your judgment seems to me too stern. At least
you must allow that their theatrical representations
are magnificent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I once resolved to go to the theatre to hear the
opera of one of my young friends—what is the name
of it? The whole world is in this opera—through
the confused bustle of dressed up men, wander the
spirits of Orcus. All here has a voice and an
almighty sound. The devil—I mean Don Juan. But
I could not endure it beyond the overture, through
which they blustered as fast as possible without perception
or understanding. And I had prepared myself
for that by a course of fasting and prayer, because
I know that the Euphon is much too severely
tried by this measure and gives an indistinct utterance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though I must admit that Mozart’s masterpieces
are generally slighted here in a most inexplicable
manner—yet Gluck’s works are very much
better represented.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think so? I once was desirous of hearing
the Iphigenia in Tauris. As soon as I entered
the theatre, I perceived they were playing the Iphigenia
in Aulis. Then—thought I, this is a mistake.
Do they call <span class='it'>this</span> Iphigenia? I was amazed—for
now the Andante came in, with which the Iphigenia
in Tauris opens, and the storm followed. There is
an interval of twenty years. All the effect, all the
admirably arranged exposition of the tragedy is lost.
A still sea—a storm—the Greeks wrecked on the
land—this is the opera. How?—has the composer
written the overture at random, so that one may play
it as he pleases and when he will, like a trumpet-piece?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I confess that is a mistake. Yet in the meantime,
they are doing all they can to raise Gluck’s
works in the general estimation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes!” said he shortly—and then smiled more
and more bitterly. Suddenly he walked off, and nothing
could detain him. In a moment he disappeared,
and for many successive days I sought him in vain
in the park.</p>

<hr class='tbk110'/>

<p class='pindent'>Several months had elapsed, when one cold, rainy
evening, having been belated in a distant part of the
city, I was going towards my house in Friedrich
street. It was necessary to pass by the theatre. The
noisy music of trumpets and kettle drums reminded
me that Gluck’s Armida was to be now performed,
and I was on the point of going in, when a curious
soliloquy spoken from the window, where every
note of the orchestra was distinctly audible, arrested
my attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now comes the king—they play the march—beat,
beat away on your kettle drums. That’s right, that’s
lively. Yes, yes, you must do that eleven times now—or
else the procession won’t be long enough. Ha,
ha—Maestro—drag along, children. See there is a
figurant with his shoe-string caught. That’s right
for the twelfth time!—Keep beating on that dominant—Oh!
ye eternal powers this will never cease.
Now he presents his compliments—Armida returns
thanks. Still once more? Yes, I see all’s right—there
are two soldiers yet to come. What evil spirit
has banished me here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ban is loosed,” cried I—“come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I seized my curious friend by the arm (for the soliloquist
was no other than he,) and hurrying him out
of the park, carried him away with me. He seemed
surprised, and followed me in silence. We had
already arrived in Friedrich street when he suddenly
stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you,” said he.—“You were in the park.
We talked together. I drank your wine—grew
heated by it. The Euphon sounded two days afterwards—I
suffered much—it is over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am rejoiced that accident has thrown you again
in my way. Let us be better acquainted. I live not
far from here—suppose you⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot, and dare not go with any one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you shall not escape me thus—I will go with
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you must go about two hundred steps.
But you were just going into the theatre?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going to hear Armida, but now⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall hear Armida <span class='it'>now</span>⁠—come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In silence we went down Friedrich street. He
turned quickly down a cross street, running so fast
that I could with difficulty follow him—until he stopped
at last before a common-looking house. After
knocking for some time the door was opened.—Groping
in the dark, we ascended the steps and
entered a chamber in the upper story, the door of
which my guide carefully locked. I heard a door
open; through this he led me with a light, and the
appearance of the curiously decorated apartment
surprised me not a little—old-fashioned, richly
adorned chairs, a clock fixed against the wall with a
gilt case, and a heavy broad mirror gave to the
whole the gloomy appearance of antiquated splendor.
In the middle stood a little Piano Forte, upon which
was placed a large inkstand; and near it lay several
sheets of music. A more attentive examination of
these arrangements for composition made it evident
to me that for some time nothing could have been
written; for the paper was perfectly yellow, and
thick spider webs were woven over the inkstand—the
man stepped towards a press in the corner of a
chamber which I had not perceived before, and as
soon as he drew aside the curtain I saw a row of
beautifully bound books with golden titles. Orfeo—Armida—Alcesti—Iphigenia—&amp;c.—in
short a collection
of Gluck’s master pieces standing together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you own all Gluck’s works?” I cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made no answer, but a spasmodic smile played
across his mouth, and the play of muscles in the
hollow cheeks distorted his countenance to the appearance
of a hideous mask—He fixed his dark eyes
sternly upon me, seized one of the books—it was
Armida—and stepped solemnly towards the piano
forte.—I opened it quickly and drew up the music
rack; that appeared to give him pleasure—He
opened the book—I beheld ruled leaves, but not a
single note written upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began; “now I will play the overture—Do you
turn over the leaves at the proper time”—I promised—and
now grasping the full chords, gloriously and
like a master, he played the majestic Tempo di
Marcia with which the overture begins, without
deviating from the original; but the Allegro was
only interpenetrated by Gluck’s principal thought.
He brought out so many rich changes that my astonishment
increased—His modulations were particularly
bold, without being startling, and so great was
his facility of hanging upon the principal idea of a
thousand melodious lyrics, that each one seemed a
reproduction of it in a new and renovated form—His
countenance glowed—now he contracted his
eyebrows and a long suppressed wrath broke powerfully
forth, and now his eyes swam in tears of deep
yearning melancholy. Sometimes with a pleasant
tenor voice he sang the Thema, while both hands
were employed in artist-like lyrics, and sometimes
he imitated with his voice in an entirely different
manner the hollow tone of the beaten kettle drums.
I industriously turned over the leaves, as I followed
his look. The overture was finished and he fell
back exhausted with closed eyes, upon the arm
chair. But soon he raised himself again and turning
hastily over a few blank leaves, said to me in a
hollow tone⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All this, sir, have I written when I came out of
the kingdom of dreams, but I betrayed the holy to
unholy, and an ice-cold hand fastened upon this
glowing heart. It broke not. Yet was I condemned
to wander among the unholy like a departed spirit—formless,
so that no one knew me until the sun-flower
again lifted me up to the eternal—Ha, now
let us sing Armida’s Scena.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he sang the closing scene of the Armida
with an expression which penetrated my inmost
heart—Here also he deviated perceptibly from the
original—but the substituted music was Gluck-like
music in still higher potency.—All that Hate, Love,
Despair, Madness, can express in its strongest traits—he
united in his tones—His voice seemed that of
a young man, for from its deep hollowness swelled
forth an irrepressible strength—Every fibre trembled—I
was beside myself—When he had finished I
threw myself into his arms, and cried with suppressed
voice—“What does this mean? Who are
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood up and gazed at me with earnest, penetrating
look—but as I was about to speak again he
vanished with the light through a door and left me in
the darkness—He was absent a quarter of an hour—I
despaired of seeing him again and ascertaining
my position from the situation of the piano forte
sought to open the door, when suddenly in an embroidered
dress coat, rich vest and with a sword at
his side and a light in his hand he entered⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>I started—he came solemnly up to me, took me
softly by the hand, and said, softly smiling⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am the Chevalier Gluck!”</p>

<div><h1><a id='late'></a>THE LATE SIR DAVID WILKIE.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY LOUIS FITZGERALD TASISTRO.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the head of Painting, England undoubtedly
at present stands considerably above any of the continental
nations; but they surpass her perhaps in an
equal degree, in the sister Art of Sculpture, and in
Music,—Italy in both of these, and Germany in the
latter. France may perhaps be said to have reached
the same general point that England has in all these
Arts; but she cannot claim the same exceptions in
favor of individual instances, in either of them. In
musical composers, on the other hand, she surpasses
England, and yet reaches to only a very moderate
degree of excellence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir David Wilkie was one of the most distinguished
Artists, in his particular line, that England, or any
other country ever possessed. He has, to be sure,
produced, comparatively speaking, but few pictures;
but in force and richness of expression, in truth and
depth of character, in subtlety of thought, and felicity
of invention, I have seen none in the same class that
at all equal these few. In the above particulars, and
in a marvellous truth and simplicity of pencil in
delineating what he sees or remembers, Wilkie as far
surpasses Teniers himself, as Teniers surpasses him
in freedom and felicity of touch, and freshness, transparency,
and beauty of coloring. And important as
these latter qualities are in a picture, those which
spring from, and appeal to, the intellect chiefly, must
be allowed to be still more so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subject of Wilkie’s pictures are confined to
what may be called the higher classes of low life,
where the habits and institutions of modern society
have hitherto, in a great measure, failed to diffuse
that artificial and conventional form of character,
which, if it does not altogether preclude the <span class='it'>action</span>
of the feelings, at least forbids all outward manifestation
of them. If Sir David had unfortunately
devoted his peculiar and unrivalled power of depicting
what <span class='it'>is</span>, to scenes in high, or even in middle life,
he would have produced works altogether feeble and
worthless; because he could only represent what
actually did exist; and, in these classes of life, <span class='it'>this</span>,
as far as regards its outward attributes, is smoothed
and polished down to a plane and colorless surface,
which will not admit the passage of any thing from
within, and from which every thing without slides off
like water-drops from the feathers of a bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only think of making a picture of a party of <span class='it'>ladies
and gentlemen</span>, assembled to hear a piece of political
news read; or of the same persons listening to a solo
on the violin by an eminent professor! And yet
these are the subjects of Wilkie’s Village Politicians,
and his Blind Fiddler; two of the most interesting and
perfect works that ever proceeded from the pencil;
and which at once evince in the artist, and excite in
the spectator, more activity of thought, and play of
sentiment, than are called forth at all the fashionable
parties of London and Paris for a whole season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilkie’s power was confined, as I have said, to
the representation of what he saw; but he selected
and combined this with such admirable judgment,
and represented it with such unrivalled truth and
precision, that his pictures impress themselves on
the memory with all the force and reality of facts.
We remember, and recur to, the scenes he places
before us, just as we should to the real scenes if we
had been present at them; and can hardly think of,
and refer to them as any thing <span class='it'>but</span> real scenes. They
seem to become part of our experience—to increase
the stores of our actual knowledge of life and human
nature; and the actors in them take their places
among the persons we have seen and known in our
intercourse with the living world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wilkie’s pictures are, in one sense of the term,
the most <span class='it'>national</span> that were ever painted; and will
carry down to posterity the face, character, habits,
costume, etc. of the period and class which they represent,
in a way that nothing else ever did or could;
for they are literally the things themselves—the
truth, and nothing but the truth. The painter allows
himself no liberty or licence in the minutest particulars.
He seems to have a superstitious reverence
for the truth; and he would no more <span class='it'>paint</span> a lie than
he would tell one. I suppose he has never introduced
an article of dress or furniture into any one of his
pictures, that he had not actually seen worn or used
under the circumstances he was representing. If he
had occasion to paint a peasant who had just entered
a cottage on a rainy day, he would, as a matter of
conscience, leave the marks of his dirty footsteps on
the threshold of the door! This scrupulous minuteness
of detail, which would be the bane of some
class of art, is the beauty of his, coupled, and made
subservient, as it was, to the most curious, natural,
and interesting development of character, sentiment
and thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the most extraordinary examples of this artist’s
professional skill, are those in which he has depicted
some peculiar <span class='it'>expression</span> in the face and action of
some one of his characters. The quantity and degree
of expression that he has, in several of these instances,
thrown into the compass of a face and figure of less
than the common miniature size, is not to be conceived
without being seen, and has certainly never before
been equalled in the Art. His most extraordinary
efforts of this kind are two, in which the expressions
are not very agreeable, but which become highly
interesting, on account of the extreme difficulty that
is felt to have been overcome in the production of
them. One of these is an old man, in the act of
coughing violently; and the other is a child, who has
cut his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if this is the most extraordinary part of Wilkie’s
pictures, and the part most likely to attract vulgar
attention and curiosity, it is far from being the
most valuable and characteristic. If it were, I should
not regard him as the really great artist which I now
do. The mere overcoming of difficulty, for the sake
of overcoming it, and without producing any other
ulterior effect, would be a mere idle waste of time
and skill, and quite unworthy either of praise or
attention. It is in these particular instances which
I have noticed above, as in numerous others in different
lines of art, a mere sleight of hand, exceedingly
curious, as exhibiting the possible extent of
human skill, but no more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Wilkie’s pictures, this exhibition of mere manual
skill is used very sparingly, and is almost always
kept in subjection to, or brought in aid of, other
infinitely more valuable ends. With the single exception
of the “Cut Finger,” which is a mere gratuitous
effort of this manual dexterity, all his pictures
are moral tales, more or less interesting, from their
perfectly true delineation of habits and manners, or
impressive, from their development of character,
passion, and sentiment. The “Opening of the Will”
is as fine in this way, as any of Sir Walter Scott’s
novels; and the “Rent Day” includes a whole series
of national tales of English pastoral life in the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a great mistake to consider Wilkie as a comic
painter, in which light he is generally regarded by
the public on both sides of the Atlantic. When they
are standing before his pictures, they seem to feel
themselves bound to be moved to laughter by them,
as they would by a comedy or a farce; and without
this, they do not show their taste; whereas laughter
seems to me to be the very last sensation these works
are adapted to call forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speaking of the best and most characteristic of
them, I would say, that scarcely any compositions of
the art, in whatever class, are calculated to excite a
greater variety of deep and serious feelings; feelings,
it is true, so uniformly tempered and modified by a
calm and delightful satisfaction, that they can scarcely
be considered without calling up a <span class='it'>smile</span> to the countenance.
But the smile arising from inward delight
is as different from the laughter excited by strangeness
and drollery as any one thing can be from
another. It is, in fact, the very essence of Wilkie’s
pictures, that there is literally nothing strange, and
consequently nothing droll and laughter-moving about
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the works of no one English artist have I
received so much pure and unmixed pleasure and
instruction as I have from those of Sir David Wilkie.
He differs from all the great old masters, inasmuch
as I think he possesses more vigor of pencil, and
more natural and characteristic truth of expression
than any of them. His style cannot, indeed, be said
to possess the airy and enchanting graces of Claude,
or the classic power and beauty of the Poussins, or
the delicious sweetness of Paul Potter, or the sunny
brightness of Wynants, or the elegant warmth of
Both, or the delightfully rural and country-fied air of
Hobbima. In fact, he has no peculiar or distinguishing
style of <span class='it'>his own</span>; and this is his great and characteristic
beauty. There is nothing in his pictures
but what belongs positively and exclusively to the
scene they profess to represent. When any of the
above qualities are required in his pictures, they are
sure to be found there; not because they are part of
<span class='it'>his</span> style, but because they are part of <span class='it'>Nature’s</span>, in
the circumstances under which he is representing
her. The <span class='it'>artist</span> never obtrudes himself to share with
nature the admiration of the spectator. And this is
a very rare and admirable quality to possess in these
days of pretence and affectation; when <span class='it'>subject</span> is
usually but a <span class='it'>secondary</span> consideration, and is kept in
submission to the display of style, manner, and what

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” said Mrs. Pemberton, drawing her
needle through a very dilapidated stocking which
she was darning, “my dear, do you know how much
your old friend Ellis is worth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pemberton looked up from his newspaper
with some surprise, as he replied, “I can’t tell exactly,
but I should think his property cannot fall
short of one hundred thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be twenty thousand a piece for each of
his five children,” said Mrs. Pemberton, apparently
pursuing some hidden train of thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not so sure of that,” returned her husband,
with a smile, “it is difficult to calculate the fortune
of a child during the life of a parent. Mr. Ellis is a
hale hearty man, and may live long enough to double
his fortune or perhaps to <span class='it'>lose</span> it all. But why are
you so interested in his affairs just now, Sarah?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To tell you the truth, husband, I have been thinking
that Edward Ellis would be a good match for
Caroline.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! pooh! Carry is but sixteen, it will be
time enough three years hence, to think of a husband
for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if a good opportunity should offer, it would
be the height of folly to let it slip only on account of
her youth. Edward is certainly very constant in his
visits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His intimacy with Charles, sufficiently accounts
for his frequent visits, and his attentions, if they mean
anything, are rather directed to Edith, as far as I can
judge,” said Mr. Pemberton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh that is only because Edith is the eldest. I
could easily manage to keep her out of the way, if
she were to interfere with Caroline’s prospects.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why not secure him for Edith, if you are so
desirous of allying him to the family?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mercy on me, husband, what should I do without
Edith? I would not, upon any account, put such a
notion into her head; nobody could supply her place
if she were to marry just now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rotation in office, my dear, is the true and just
system in family government, whatever it may be in
politics; it is time that Caroline shared some of
Edith’s manifold duties,” said Mr. Pemberton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How little men know of domestic affairs,” exclaimed
Mrs. Pemberton; “do you suppose that such
a giddy creature as Carry could ever be taught the
patience, industry and thoughtfulness which seem so
natural to Edith? No, no, I must keep Edith at home
as long as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you have come to the conclusion that she is
too useful to be allowed to seek her own happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. Pemberton how can you talk so? I am
sure if Edith really loved any body I would never
throw any obstacle in her way. She is quite contented
now and I don’t believe marriage is necessary
to the happiness of every body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why then are you so anxious to make matches
for your girls? Why not wait and see whether
Carry is not also content to be single?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because Caroline is such a hare-brained, thoughtless
girl, that nothing but domestic duties will ever
give her steadiness of character, and therefore I am
anxious to see her settled in life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well I don’t think you need waste any feminine
manœuvres upon Edward Ellis, for whatever
fortune his father may possess, he will never support
his sons in idleness. He means that they shall work
for themselves as he has done, and though he has
given Edward a liberal education, he intends to make
him a thorough merchant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edward wishes to study a profession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know old Ellis well enough to believe that he
sets too high a value on time and money to consent
to such a plan. He would never be willing to maintain
Edward during the next ten years, as must
necessarily be the case, if he adopted a profession.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edward is a remarkably fine young man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he possesses excellent talents and an amiable
disposition, but his character is yet to be formed
by time and circumstance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is two and twenty, husband; and you were
married when you were not that age.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know it, Sarah,” said Mr. Pemberton, drily,
“and we both married five years too soon. I became
burdened with the support of a family at the outset
of life, and you were weighed down with domestic
cares, while yet in your girlhood; the consequence
to me has been, that I am now obliged to labour as
hard for a living at forty-five as I did at twenty,
and with as little prospect of making a fortune; while
the result to you has been broken health and wearied
spirits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure I never repented our marriage, my
dear,” said Mrs. Pemberton half reproachfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I, my dear Sarah,” replied her husband
kindly, “it would be but an ill requital for all your
affection and goodness; but should we not be equally
happy and less care-worn now, if we had deferred
our union until we had been a little older and wiser?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah well,” sighed Mrs. Pemberton, feeling the
truth of her husband’s remark, but unwilling to confess
it, “there is no use in such retrospection; we
have a large family around us, and there are no finer
children than ours in the whole circle of our acquaintance.
If I am broken down with the care of bringing
them up, I can forget all my trouble, when I have so
much cause to be proud of them. A better daughter
than Edith, a more steady boy than Charley, and
prettier girls than Caroline and Maria, are not to be
found anywhere in society; and I dare say I shall
be just as proud of the little ones in the nursery as
they grow up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare say you will, my dear,” said her husband,
smiling good-humoredly, “it would be very strange
if you were not, and quite as strange if I had not
similar opinions; Edith is as good as she is handsome
and I only wish young Ellis was in circumstances to
marry her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t speak of such a thing, husband, I cannot
consent to part with her for the next four or five
years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you want to get rid of Caroline.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have already told you my motives; there never
were two sisters more unlike.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edith has all the prudence and kindliness which
befits a good wife, and therefore deserves to be well
mated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She does not seem to think of such a thing as
marriage, and I am truly glad she is so indifferent
about it, indeed I almost believe that Edith is destined
to be an old maid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It needs no great prophetic skill to predict that,
if you keep her forever in the back-ground.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure I do no such thing,” said Mrs. Pemberton,
warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t pretend to know much about these matters
but I have noticed that when the girls are invited to
a party it is generally Edith who is left at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not my fault, Mr. Pemberton, if she takes
no pleasure in gay society.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you certain she always stays at home from
choice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare say she does, at least she is never controlled
by me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you know as well as I do, that the slightest
expression of a wish is sufficient to influence her.
The truth is, Edith has made herself so useful in the
family that we all depend upon her for a large portion
of our comforts, and are too apt to forget that
she often sacrifices her own. Do you suppose that
she actually preferred staying at home to nurse little
Margaret, the other night, to going to Mrs. Moore’s
grand ball?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I can’t say she did, for she seemed rather
anxious to attend that ball, and had trimmed a dress
beautifully for the occasion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The child was certainly not so ill as to require
her attendance in addition to yours, and why, therefore,
was she obliged to remain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, the baby was not very sick, but she cried so
bitterly when she saw Edith dressed for the party,
that I was afraid she would bring on a fever.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Therefore you disappointed Edith merely to
gratify the whim of a petted infant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I left her to do as she pleased; she immediately
changed her dress, to pacify Margaret, and took her
usual place by the cradle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you left her to do as she pleased, after she
had been allowed to discover exactly what you wished
she should do. This is always the way, Sarah;
the incident just mentioned, is only one out of hundreds,
where Edith’s kind feelings have been made to
interfere with her pleasures. I have long seen in the
family a disposition to take advantage of her unselfish
character, and it seems to me exceedingly unjust.
I do not want to part with Edith, and should give her
to a husband with great reluctance, but I insist that
she should have a fair chance, and not be compelled
to join the single sisterhood whether she will or not.
You had better let match-making alone, Sarah; leave
the girls to choose for themselves; only be careful
that they have the right sort of admirers, from which
to select their future master.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith Pemberton was the eldest of a large family.
Her father, immersed in business like most of our
American merchants, spent the working days of
every week at his counting room, only returning at
evening, jaded and fatigued, to read the newspaper,
and to doze upon the sofa till bed time. Governed by
the erroneous ideas, which led men, in our country,
to attempt the accumulation of a rapid fortune, in
the vain hope of enjoying perfect leisure in their later
years, Mr. Pemberton had become little more than a
money-making machine. He loved his family but he
had little time to devote to them. He spared no expense
in the education of his children, liberally provided
them with comforts, and punctually paid all
the family bills, but he left all the management of
household matters to his wife, who soon found it utterly
useless to consult him on any domestic arrangement.
His purse was always open to her demands,
but his time he could not give. The consequence
was that Mrs. Pemberton while endeavoring conscientiously
to perform her duties, made the usual
mistake, and fell into those habits which often convert
our good wives into mere housekeepers and
nurse maids; “household drudges” as our grumbling
cousin Bull calls them. A rapidly increasing family,
and her utter ignorance of her husband’s business
prospects, induced her to practise the strictest economy
which was consistent with comfort. Abandoning
the elegant accomplishments which she had acquired
with so much expense of time and labor at
school, she secluded herself in her nursery, and in
the care of her children and the duties of housekeeping
found full employment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In childhood, Edith was what old ladies call ‘a
nice quiet little girl.’ Her delicate features, fair
complexion, and blonde hair, established her claim
to infantile beauty, while her bright smile, sweet
voice and graceful gentleness seemed to win the love
of all who knew her. Endowed with no remarkable
intellect, no decided genius, she yet managed, by
dint of good sense, industry and perseverance, to
maintain her place at the head of her classes, and to
leave school, which she did at fifteen, with the reputation
of a very good scholar. A plain, but thorough
English education, a little French, a few not very
ill done drawings in water colors; some velvet paintings
and a profound knowledge of the art of stitching
in all its varieties, were the fruits of Edith’s studies.
Gentle reader, do not despise the scanty list of accomplishments
which she could number. It comprised
the usual course of education at that time, and perhaps,
in point of real usefulness, would bear a fair
comparison with the more imposing “<span class='it'>sciences</span>”
and “<span class='it'>ologies</span>” which are now <span class='it'>presumed</span> to be taught
in schools of higher pretensions. Her skill in
<span class='it'>needlecraft</span> was a most valuable acquisition to the
eldest daughter of so numerous a family, and Mrs.
Pemberton availed herself fully of its aid. Edith
returned from school only to take her place as an
assistant to her mother in the nursery. The maid
whose business it was to take care of the children,
was not trustworthy, and it became the duty of Edith
to watch over the welfare of the little ones, while
she employed her busy fingers in shaping and sewing
their multifarious garments. Kindly in her feelings,
affectionate in her disposition, gentle and patient in
temper, she was dearly loved by the children. It
was soon discovered that her influence could do more
than the clamor of an impatient nursemaid, or the
frown of a mother whose natural good temper had
been fretted into irritability. If a child was refractory,
sister Edith alone could administer medicine,
or smooth the uneasy pillow,—and in short Edith became
a kind of second mother to her five sisters and
three brothers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had her nature been in the slightest degree tainted
with selfishness, she might have reasonably murmured
against the heavy burdens which were laid
upon her at so early an age. But Edith never thought
of herself. To contribute to the happiness of others
was her chief pleasure, and she seemed totally unconscious
of the value of her daily sacrifices. If any
particularly disagreeable piece of work was to be
done, it was always concluded that Edith would not
refuse to undertake it; if any one was compelled to
forego some anticipated pleasure, the lot was sure
to fall on Edith; and in short the total absence of selfishness
in her seemed to be the warrant for a double
allowance of that ingredient in the characters of all
around her. Have you never met, friend reader,
with one of those kind, affectionate, ingenuous persons
who have the knack of doing every thing well,
and the tact of doing every thing kindly? and did you
never observe that with this useful and willing person,
every body seemed to claim the right of sharing
their troubles? Such an one was Edith Pemberton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Edith was not proof against that passion which
is usually libelled as selfish and engrossing. Edward
Ellis had cultivated an intimacy with her young and
studious brother, solely on her account, and the
patience with which the gifted “senior,” assisted the
efforts of the zealous “sophomore,” might be attributed
less to friendship than to a warmer emotion.
Ellis was talented, ambitious and vain, but he was
also warm-hearted, and susceptible to virtuous impressions.
The perfect gentleness, the feminine delicacy,
the modest beauty of Edith had charmed the
romantic student, and her unaffected admiration of
his superior mental endowments, completed the spell
of her fascination. His parents, well knowing how
strong a safeguard against evil influences, is a virtuous
attachment, rather encouraged his intimacy with
the Pemberton family, without enquiring closely into
his motives; and Edward was content to enjoy the
present, leaving the future to take care of itself. In
compliance with his wishes, his father had given
him a liberal education, but when, upon leaving college
he requested permission to study some profession,
he met with a decided negative. “I wish you
to be a merchant, Edward,” said his father, “I have
given you an education which will enable you to be
an enlightened and intelligent one, but upon yourself
it depends to become a rich one. Talents and learning
without money are of as little use as rough gems;
they are curiosities for the cabinet of the virtuoso,
not valuables to the man of sense; they must be
polished and set in a golden frame before they can
adorn the possessor, or seem precious in the eyes of
the multitude. If you are wealthy, a little wisdom
will procure you a great reputation; if you are poor
your brightest talents only serve as a farthing rush-light
to show you your own misery!” Such were
the views of Mr. Ellis, and though his son differed
widely from him in feeling, yet he dared not gainsay
the assertions which he deemed the result of experience
and worldly wisdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was but a few days after the conversation just
narrated that another of a different character took
place between two of the parties interested. Edith
was returning from a visit to a sick friend, just as
evening was closing in, when she was met at her
door, by Edward Ellis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come with me, Edith,” said Edward hurriedly,
“wrap your shawl about you, and walk with me on
the Battery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now, Mr. Ellis,” replied Edith, “it is quite
late, and little Madge is waiting for me to sing her to
sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Psha! Edith, you are always thinking of some
family matter; do you ever think of your own
wishes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” replied Edith, laughing, “and I confess I
should prefer a pleasant walk with you to a warm
and noisy nursery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then come,” said Edward, drawing her arm
through his, “I have something of great consequence
to say to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith looked surprised, but the expression of Edward’s
countenance was anxious and troubled, so
she offered no further opposition. They entered the
Battery, and walked along the river side, for some
minutes in perfect silence, before Edward could
summon courage to enter upon the subject nearest
his thoughts. At length as they turned into a less
frequented path, he abruptly exclaimed, “Do you
know, Edith, that I am going away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith’s heart gave a sudden bound, and then every
pulsation seemed as suddenly to cease, as with trembling
voice she uttered a faint exclamation of astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are surprised, Edith, I knew you would be
so, but have you no other feeling at this announcement
of my departure? Nay, turn not your sweet
face from me; I must know whether your heart
responds to mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith blushed and trembled as she thus listened,
for the first time, to the voice of passionate tenderness.
Feelings which had long been growing up
unnoticed in her heart, and to which she had never
thought of giving a name—fancies, beautiful in their
vagueness,—emotions undefined and undetermined,
but still pleasant in the indulgence,—all the</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>found in that instant their object and their aim.
Edith had never thought of Edward as a lover, she
had never looked into her heart to discover whether
she really wished him to be such, but at the magic
voice of affection, the mystery of her own heart was
revealed to her, its secret recesses were unveiled to
her gaze, and she knew that his image had long been
there unconsciously enshrined. Her lover saw not
all her emotions in her expressive countenance, but
he read there no repulsive coldness, and as he
clasped the little hand, which lay on his arm, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen to me, dear Edith; my father informed
me, to-day, that he has made an arrangement with
my uncle, (whom, as you know, has long resided at
Smyrna,) by which I am to become the junior partner
in the house, and he has directed me to be ready in
three weeks, to sail in one of his ships, now lading
for that port. How long I shall be absent, is uncertain,
but as my uncle is desirous of returning to
America, I presume that it is intended I shall take his
place abroad. Years, therefore, may elapse ere I
again behold my native land, and I cannot depart
without telling you how dear you have long been to
my heart. Yet let me not deceive you Edith: I have
confessed to my father my affection for you,—he
acknowledges your worth, and does not disapprove
my choice, but he has positively forbidden me to
form any engagement for the future. I am violating
his commands in thus expressing my feelings to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are his objections, Edward?” faltered the
trembling girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh it is the old story of over-prudent age; he
says we may both change long before I return, and
that it is best to be unfettered by any promise; then
no harm can happen to either, and if you love me you
will wait my return, without requiring any engagement
to confirm your faith. Thus he argues and I
can make no reply. I have no means of supporting
a wife, therefore I dare not ask you of your parents,
and my father’s caution deprives me of the only
comfort which hope might have afforded me in my
exile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith was deeply agitated, and her cheek grew
pale, as she murmured: “You are right in obeying
your father, Edward; happiness never yet waited on
one who was deficient in filial duty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is this all you can say, Edith,” exclaimed
Edward passionately. “Is this cold approval all I
can hope to receive from the object of my first and
only love? Have not my every look and tone told
you how deeply I loved you, and can you let me
depart without one word of tenderness or regret?
Must I remember your gentle face but as a dream of
boyhood? Shall your low, sweet voice be but as the
melody of by-gone years? May I not bear with me,
in my banishment, a hope, faint and cold it may be as
the winter sunbeam, yet lighting up my dreary path
with something like a promise of future happiness?
Edith I ask no plighted faith; I wish you not to
pledge me your hand till I can come forward and
claim it openly; but I would fain know whether my
love is but as incense flung upon the winds. If you
can offer no return to my affection, dearest, let me
at once know my fate, and with all the force of an
over-mastering will, shall my heart be silenced, if
not subdued. Say that you love me not, Edith, and
though the stream of my life must forever bear your
image on its surface, yet you shall never know how
dark has been the shadow it has cast. Say that you
love me not, and you shall never hear a murmur
from my lips, nor shall your peaceful existence be
saddened by the gloom which must ever pervade
mine. You are silent Edith—you cannot bear to utter
the words which must condemn me to despair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ellis paused, and strove to read in Edith’s face,
the feelings to which she could not give utterance.
But her eyes were bent upon the ground, while the
big tears fell like rain from beneath the drooping lids
and in her flushed cheek he saw only displeasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was right, Edith,” said he, sadly, “you do not
love me; forgive and forget my folly, but let us not
part in coldness.” He took her hand again, as he
spoke: “I perhaps deserve punishment for my selfishness
in thus asking the heart when I could not
claim the hand; when I am gone, some happier lover
will perhaps ask both and then⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will be denied,” interrupted Edith, hastily,
turning her agitated face towards her suitor. “This
is no time for maiden coyness, Edward; your happiness
and mine are both at stake, and therefore I tell
you, what till this moment was unknown even to
myself, that my affections are in your keeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dearest, dearest Edith, then am I supremely
happy; I ask no more; let the only bond between
us be the secret one of cherished love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so, Edward; you have promised your father
not to enter into any engagement, but I am bound by
no such restraints. You are, and must remain free
from all other bonds than those of feeling, but if it
will add to your happiness to be assured of my faith
during your absence, I pledge you my word that my
hand shall be yours whenever you come to claim it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your parents, Edith,—what will they say, if
they find you clinging to a remembered lover, and
perhaps rejecting some advantageous settlement?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will suffer me to pursue my own course,
Edward, and will be satisfied with any thing that
binds me to my childhood’s home. I am too much
the companion of my parents to be looked upon in
the light of an intruder, when I prolong the period of
filial dependence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then be it so, dearest; bound by no outward
pledge, we will cherish our affection within our
hearts, and since we must part, you will still gladden
your quiet home with your sweet presence, while I
will wander forth to win the fortune which can alone
secure me my future happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three weeks after this interview, Edward Ellis
sailed for Smyrna, and Mrs. Pemberton, as she witnessed
the ill-disguised agitation of the lovers, was
compelled to acknowledge that “after all, she really
believed, if Edward had staid, there would have been
a match between him and Edith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Edith buried within her own bosom, her newly
awakened emotions. Her manner was always so
quiet, that if her step did become less light, and her
voice grow softer in its melancholy cadence, it was
scarcely noticed by her thoughtless companions. She
had learned that she was beloved, only in the moment
of separation, and therefore there were few tender
and blissful recollections to beguile the weary days
of absence; but</p>

<p class='line0'>Affection gives, and hallows!”</p>

<p class='noindent'>She was one of those gentle beings who draw from
the font of tenderness within their own bosoms, a
full draught of sympathy for the sufferings and wants
of others. She returned to her self-denying duties
with a more thoughtful spirit and a more loving
heart. Her character, always full of goodness and
truth, seemed to assume an elevation of feeling, such
as nothing but a pure and unselfish attachment can
ever create. A desire to become in all respects,
worthy of him whom she loved, gave a new tone to
all her impulses, and her vivid sense of duty became
blended with her earnest desire to merit her future
happiness. Edward wrote very punctually to his
young friend Charles Pemberton, and every letter
contained some message to Edith, but she alone could
detect the secret meaning of the apparently careless
lines. They afforded sufficient nutriment to the love
which was rapidly becoming a part of her very
being; and Edith was content to abide her time!</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the mean time Mrs. Pemberton, who became an
adept in match-making, busied herself in providing
for her younger girls, and was fortunate enough to
secure two most eligible offers. Caroline, at eighteen
became the wife of a promising young lawyer, while
Maria, who was nearly two years younger, married
at the same time a prosperous merchant, who had
lately set up his carriage and, as he had no time to
use it himself, wanted a wife to ride in it. Mrs.
Pemberton was in ecstasies, for she had succeeded
in all her plans. Edith was still at home, as a sort
of house keeper, head cook, chief nurse, etc. etc.,
sharing every body’s labors and lightening every
body’s troubles, while the two giddy girls who had
resolved not to become useful as long as they could
avoid the necessity of it, were respectably settled in
their own homes. She was never tired of extolling
the talents of one son-in-law, and the fine fortune of
the other, while she spoke of Edith as “that dear
good girl, who, I am happy to say, is a confirmed
old maid, and will never leave her mother while
she lives.” But this manœuvre did not discourage
several from seeking the hand of the gentle girl.
Her father wondered when she refused two of the
most unexceptionable offers, and even her mother
felt almost sorry, when she declined the addresses
of an elderly widower, endowed with a fortune of
half a million, and a family of fine children. But a
total want of congeniality of feeling in all her immediate
friends, had taught Edith a degree of reserve
which seemed effectually to conceal her deepest
feelings. She was patient and trustful, she considered
herself affianced in heart, and though conscious that
not even the tie of honor, as the world would consider
it, bound her lover to his troth, she felt no misgivings
as to his fidelity. She trod the even tenor of
her way, diffusing cheerfulness and comfort around
her, thinking for every body, remembering every
thing and forgetting only herself. None sought her
sympathy or assistance in vain; in her own family—in
the chamber of sickness or death, among her
friends,—in the hovel of poverty and distress, she
was alike useful and kindly. Every one loved her,
and even those who tested her powers of endurance
most fully, almost idolized the unselfish and affectionate
daughter and sister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Years passed on, and brought their usual chances
and charges. Caroline became a mother, and fancied
that her cares were quite too heavy for her to bear
alone. Edith was therefore summoned to assist and
soon found herself occupying a similar station in her
sister’s nursery to that which she had long filled at
home. The baby was often sick and always cross;
nobody but Edith could manage him, and therefore
Edith took the entire charge of him, while the
mother paid visits and the nurse gossiped in the
kitchen. Maria too began to assert claims upon her.
She, poor thing, was entirely too young for the duties
she had undertaken. Thoughtless, fond of dress,
and profuse in household expenditure, she had no
idea of systematic housekeeping, and Edith was
called in to place matters on a better footing. But
before Maria had attained her eighteenth year, her
family was rather liberally increased by the addition
of twin daughters, and again the agency of the useful
sister was required. Her girlhood had been consumed
amid womanly cares, and now her years of
blooming womanhood were to be wasted in supplying
the deficiencies of those who had incurred responsibilities
which exceeded their powers. Yet Edith
never thought of murmuring. She had been so long
accustomed to live for others that self-sacrifice had
now become habitual, and she never dreamed too
much might be asked of or granted by sisterly affection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a common remark that the years seem to
grow shorter as we advance in life, and they who
could once exclaim “<span class='it'>a whole year!</span>” in accents of
unqualified alarm at its length, at last find themselves
referring to the same space in the careless
tone of indifference as “<span class='it'>only a year</span>.” Twelve
months had seemed almost an eternity to Edith when
her lover first bade her farewell, and the time that
intervened between his letters to her brother seemed
almost endless. But as she became engrossed in
new cares, and her youth began to slip by, the years
seemed to revolve with greater speed, even although
Charles was now in a distant part of the country and
the correspondence between him and her lover
if it was still continued, never met her eye. She
had formed an intimacy with Edward’s mother, and,
as the old lady was very fond of needle-worked pin-cushions,
net purses, worsted fire screens, and all
such little nick nacks if obtained without expense,
Edith was soon established in her good graces. She
was thus enabled to see Edward’s letters to his parents,
and though they were very business-like commonplace
affairs, not at all resembling a lady’s beau-ideal
of a lover’s epistle, still Edith was satisfied. It
was strange that so strong, so abiding, so pervading
a passion should have taken possession of a creature
so gentle, so almost cold in her demeanor. But the
calmest exterior often conceals the strongest emotions,
and, if the flow of Edith’s feelings was quiet it
was only because they worked for themselves a
deeper and less fathomable channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seventeen years,—a long period in the annals of
time, and a longer in the records of the heart;—seventeen
years passed ere Edward Ellis returned to
his native land. He had left it a romantic warm-hearted
youth and he returned a respectable, intelligent,
wealthy man. The ambition which would
have led him to seek literary fame, had been expended
in search of other distinctions in the world of
commerce. He had become a keen observer of men
and an acute student of the more sordid qualities of
human nature—in a word, he had devoted his fine
energies to the acquisition of wealth, and as his
father predicted, he had so well availed himself of
his opportunities that he was both an enlightened
and rich merchant. But the romance of his early
days had long since passed away. The imaginative
student was concealed or rather lost in the man of
the world. Thrown upon his own resources, in a
foreign land, and surrounded by strangers he had
learned to think and act for himself. He had acquired
the worldly wisdom which enabled him to
study his own interests, and it is not strange that
selfishness should have mingled its alloy with his
naturally amiable character. During his long sojourn
abroad no claims had been made upon his affections,
he had lived unloving and unloved, and the warm
current of his feelings seemed gradually to have
become chilled. When seen through the mist of
absence, or viewed through the long vista of time,
the familiar faces of his distant home, faded into
vague and indistinct images. He returned to the
scenes of his youth with a feeling of strangeness and
the remembrances at every step of his approach were
rather mournful than pleasant to his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward Ellis had been several days at home, he had
fully answered all the claims filial and fraternal duty,
and received the congratulations of the friends who
are always found ready to note one’s good fortune,
ere he bent his steps towards the dwelling of Edith
Pemberton. His feelings in this as in most other
things were materially altered. His early passion,
like his aspirations after fame, had become but as a
dream of the past, a shadow of some unattainable
felicity. The hope which once made his love a
source of anticipated happiness, had long since faded
from his sight, and as time passed on, a tender and
melancholy interest, such as one feels when regarding
the youthful dead, was the only emotion which
the recollection of Edith could inspire. He had outlived
the affection which he had designed to be the
measure of their existence. The flower had been
blighted by the cold breath of worldliness, and so
many sordid interests had occupied his heart since,
that every trace of its beauty was lost forever. Not
with a wish to revive old feelings, but from a morbid
restless unsatisfied yearning towards the past, Ellis
betook himself to the abode of his once loved Edith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he entered the hall, and ere the servant could
announce his name, a young lady emerged from the
drawing-room, and met him face to face. He started
in unfeigned surprise, as he exclaimed:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Pemberton!—Edith—can it be possible?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady looked a little alarmed, and opening the
door through which she had just passed said:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Margaret, sir; did you wish to see
sister Edith?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered in the affirmative, and as he took his
seat while the sylph-like figure of the beautiful girl
disappeared, he could not help glancing at the mirror,
where a moment’s reflection soon convinced
him that the years which had so changed him could
scarcely have left Edith untouched. The thought that
Margaret whom he had left almost an infant should
have thus expanded into the lovely image of her sister,
prepared him in some measure for other changes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith had expected his visit with a flutter of spirits
most unusual and distressing. She was conscious
that he would find her sadly altered in person, and
she had been trying to school herself for the interview,
which she well knew must be fraught with
pain even if it brought happiness. But when her
young sister came to her with a ludicrous account of
the strange gentleman’s droll mistake, her prophetic
soul, which had acquired the gift of prescience from
sorrow, saw but too plainly the cloud upon her
future. She descended to the drawing-room with a
determination to control her emotions, and, to one so
accustomed to self command, the task though difficult
was not impossible. The meeting between the long
parted lovers was painful and full of constraint. In
the emaciated figure, and hollow cheek of her who
had long passed the spring of life, Ellis saw little to
awaken the associations of early affection, for the
being who now appeared before him scarcely retained
a trace of her former self. Time, and care, and the
wearing anxiety of hope deferred had blighted the
beauty which under happier circumstances might
have outlived her youthfulness. Edith was now only
a placid pleasant looking woman with that indescribable
air of mannerism which always characterises the
single lady of a certain age, and as Ellis compared
her present appearance with that of her blooming
sister, who bore a most singular resemblance to her,
he was tempted to feel a secret satisfaction in the
belief that her heart was as much changed as her
person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And what felt Edith at this meeting? She had lived
on one sweet hope, and had borne absence, and sorrow,
and the wasting of weary expectancy with the
patience of a loving and trusting heart. It is true
that, as years sped on, she lost much of the sanguine
temper which once seemed to abbreviate time and
diminish space. It is true that as time stole the
bloom from her cheek and the brightness from her
eye, many a misgiving troubled her gentle bosom,
and the shadow of a settled grief seemed gradually
extending its gloom over her feelings. But still hope
existed,—no longer as the brilliant sunshine of existence,—no
longer as the only hope which the future
could afford,—but faded and dim—its radiance lost in
the mist of years, yet still retaining a spark of its
early warmth. She had many doubts and fears but
she still had pleasant fancies of the future, which,
cherished in her secret heart, were the only fountains
of delight in the dreary desert of her wasted
feelings. But now all was at an end. They had
met, not as strangers, but, far worse, as estranged
friends. The dream of her life was rudely broken—the
veil was lifted from her eyes,—the illusion which
had given all she knew of happiness, was destroyed
forever. In the words of him who has sounded
every string of love’s sweet lyre, she might have
exclaimed in the bitterness of her heart:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pemberton at first formed some schemes,
founded on the remembrance of Edward’s former
liking for Edith, but when she learned his error
respecting Margaret she began to fancy that if her
eldest daughter was a little too old, the younger was
none too young to make a good wife for the rich
merchant. She expressed her admiration of his
expanded figure, extolled his fine hair, which happened
to be a well made wig, was in raptures with
his beautiful teeth which owed their brilliancy to the
skill of a French dentist, and, in short, left no means
untried to accomplish her end. But she was doomed
to disappointment. It is not easy to kindle a new
flame from the ashes of an extinguished passion.
There was a secret consciousness, a sense of dissatisfaction
with himself, that made Ellis rather shrink
from Edith’s society, and threw an air of constraint
over his manner towards the whole family. He was
not happy in the presence of her who appeared
before him as a spectre of the past, bearing reproaches
in its melancholy countenance, and after a few embarrassed
attempts at carelessness in his intercourse
with her, he ceased entirely to visit the family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one ever knew what Edith suffered, for no one
suspected her long-cherished attachment. Her step
became languid, her cheek sunken, her eye unnaturally
bright, and when at length, a hacking cough fastened
itself upon her lungs, every body said that Edith
Pemberton was falling into a consumption. Some
attributed it to a cold taken when nursing her sister
through a dangerous illness,—others thought she had
worn out her health among her numerous nephews
and nieces. But the worm lay at the root of the
tree and though the storm and the wind might work
its final overthrow, the true cause of its fall was the
gnawing of the secret destroyer. Gradually and
quietly and silently she faded from among the living.
Friends gathered round her couch of suffering and the
consolations of the Book of all truth smoothed her
passage to the tomb. With a world of sorrow and
care sinking from her view, and an eternal life of
happiness opening upon her dying eyes, she closed
her useful and blameless life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the very day fixed upon for his marriage with
a young and fashionable heiress, Edward Ellis received
a summons to attend, as pall bearer, the
funeral of Edith Pemberton. Of course he could not
decline, and as he beheld the earth flung upon the
coffin which concealed the faded form of her whom
he had once loved, the heart of the selfish and
worldly man was touched with pity and remorse.
But he turned from Edith’s grave to his own bridal
and in the festivities of that gay scene soon forgot
her who, after a life spent in the service of others,
had fallen a victim to that chronic heart-break which
destroys many a victim never numbered in the
records of mortality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gentle reader, I have told you a simple story, but
one so like the truth, that you will be tempted to
conjecture that the real heroine has been actually
known to you. Will not the circle of your own
acquaintance furnish an Edith Pemberton?—a gentle,
lovely and loveable woman, who leads a life of quiet
benevolence, and whose obscure and peaceful existence
is marked by deeds of kindness, even as the
windings of a summer brook are traced by the freshness
of the verdure and flowers that adorn its banks?
Have you never met with one of those persons on
whose gravestone might be inscribed the beautiful
and touching lines of the poet Delille?</p>

<div><h1><a id='tho'></a>THOUGHTS ON MUSIC.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY HENRY COOD WATSON.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From whence does the Musician draw his inspiration?
This question is often asked, but seldom correctly
answered. Music, as a science, is but little
understood. The importance of its detail is not considered,
because its effects are not examined, by the
appreciating eye of knowledge. To common observers,
music possesses no feature worthy of consideration,
beyond an accidental succession of notes,
which gives a pleasing sensation to the ear, without
intention or design. Most persons believe that they
could write music, if they only knew their notes.
To “turn” a melody is the easiest thing in life, and
all the adjuncts, harmony and instrumentation, are
merely mechanical parts of the art, which every one
might learn. This is a popular and very gross error.
Music is either a simple succession of relative intervals,
which form a melody, or an aggregate of consonant
or dissonant sounds, which produces a harmony.
These two combined, form a vehicle for the
expression of the passions of the human heart, more
forcible and more truthful, than the noblest works of
either the painter or the poet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would require too much space, and would lead
me too far from my original subject, to enquire into,
and to trace out, the means by which simple sounds,
produced by vibration, percussion or detonation,
affect the mind and imagination of the hearer. It
will be sufficient to say, that the individual experience
of every one, will bear witness to the existence of
this most powerful agency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The music of a low sweet voice, how it penetrates
and vibrates through the whole being! The music
of the small birds, though limited in its scale, how it
fills up the measure of the imagination, by giving a
voice of harmony to the silent beauties of nature.
The pealing organ with its various tones, breathes
out religious strains, and moves the heart to penitence
and prayer. This instrument is suited above all
others, to display the imagination of a master hand,
from the vast extent of its compass, and the almost
endless variety of its powers by combinations. It
affects the imagination more than any individual
instrument, or any combination of instruments. How
deep and varied the emotions of the heart of him,
whose “spirit is attentive,” while listening to one
of the sublime masses of Mozart, Haydn or Beethoven.
With what a thrilling and awful feeling, the
dark, mysterious and wailing miserere falls upon the
soul; and with what a happy contrast, does the
beautiful and comforting benedictus, pour “oil upon
the bruised spirit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shrill fife, the hollow drum and the clangourous
trumpet, speak to other and wilder passions of
our hearts. They breathe an inspiration into the
mind; they nerve the arm, make firm the tread, and
give an animated existence to slumbering ambition,
or wavering courage. The soft toned flute, the plaintive
oboe, the mellow clarionette, with the other
various harmonious instruments, under the influence
of the creative mind, affect to smiles or tears, discourse
of love, or breathe of hate, according to the
shades of feeling pourtrayed by the composition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But by what means is the imitation of these non-tangible
things, transferred to a medium, which is
not visible to the eye, nor distinguishable to the
touch? From whence does the musician draw, to
enable him to affect his hearers, by the means of
sound, with the very feelings which he attempts to
imitate? We will proceed to answer these inquiries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The task of the poet is one of less difficulty, than
the task of the musician, for he treats of real or
imaginary subjects, with the aid of a medium that is
universally understood and appreciated, according to
the various degrees, and powers of the peruser’s
intellect. This medium is language. Words embody
and define ideas; a word can express a passion,
and other words can describe its rise and progress,
and follow it in all its secret channels, and through
all its numerous ramifications. The power of language
is unbounded. Every thing that is, has a
name, which name becomes associated with it in the
mind, and inseparable from it, always presenting
to the mental vision the object that it represents.
The most subtle emotions of the human mind, feelings
which lie deep in the recesses of the heart, can
be torn from their lair, and displayed before the
world by means of this mighty agent. Even nature
with her ten thousand hoarded secrets, is over mastered,
and bares her bosom to the force of thought,
and stands revealed to the world, yea, even to her
innermost core, by the power of language. To aid
him in the task, the poet hath a million adjuncts. He
moves amidst the human world, and gathers from its
denizens, unending food for thought and observation,—their
joys and their sorrows; their pursuits and
their ends; their passions and their vices, their virtues
and their charities. The life of a single being
in that living mass, would form a subject of varied
and startling interest, and leave but little for the imagination
to fill up, or to heighten. He looks up into
the heavens, and finds a space of boundless immensity,
in which his restless speculation may run riot.
He looks abroad upon the face of nature, and there
are endless stores of bright and beautiful things, to
feed his fancy, to stimulate his imagination and refresh
his thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How few of these fruitful themes, are available to
the musician!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The painter in all his beautiful creations, pourtrays
his subjects by the means of the actual. From the
living loveliness which he daily sees, he hoards up
rich stores of beauty, for some happy thought. But
to aid him in his labors, he has the actual form and
color, light and shade. The forms of beauty that
glow and breathe upon the canvass; the quiet landscape,
so full of harmony and peacefulness; the rolling
ocean, the strife of the elements, the wild commingling
of warring men, are but the transcripts of
the actual things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sculptor as he hews from the rough block,
some form of exquisite loveliness, whose charms
shall throw a spell over men’s souls for ages, does
but compress into one fair creation, the beauties of a
thousand living models.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the resources of the musician are in his own
soul. From that alone can he forge the chain of
melody, that shall bind the senses in a wordless ecstasy.
Tangibilities to him are useless. Comparisons
are of no avail. He individualises, but does not reflect.
He feels but does not think. He deals with
action and emotion, but form and substance are
beyond his imitation. He is a metaphysician, but
not a philosopher. But the depth of the music, will
depend entirely upon the man. From a close study
of the works of Mozart and Beethoven, a correct and
metaphysical analysis of their characters can be obtained.
In the early works of Mozart will be found
a continuous chain of tender and impassioned sentiment;
an overflowing of soul, an exuberance of
love, and his early life will be found to be a counterpart
of these emotions. In him the passions were
developed at an age, when in ordinary children their
germ would be scarcely observed. Loved almost to
idolatry by his family, and loving them as fondly in
return, his life was passed in one unceasing round of
the tenderest endearments. All that was beautiful
in his nature was brought into action, and gave that
tone of exquisite tenderness, that pervades all his
imperishable works. But as the passing years brought
with them an increase of thought and reflection, a
change is to be found equally in the character of the
music and the man. This change can be traced in
his later operas, Le Nozze de Figaro, Don Giovanni,
Cosi Fan Tutti, La Clemenza di Tito, Die Zauberflöte,
and Die Entführung aus dem Serail. In these
works there is the evidence of deeper and more comprehensive
thought; the metaphysical identity of
character is as strictly maintained, and as closely
developed, as it could be pourtrayed by words. His
Il Don Giovanni, stands now, and will forever stand,
an unapproachable model of musical perfection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The character of Beethoven exhibits no decided
change through life, excepting, that in his later years
the characteristics of his youth and manhood, increased
to a degree of morbid acuteness. From his
earliest childhood he was of a retiring, studious, and
reflective nature. The conscious possession of great
genius, made him wilful and unyielding in his
opinions. Too high minded to court favours, he at
various times suffered the severest privations that
poverty could inflict; and, taking deeply to heart the
total want of public appreciation, he became morose,
distrustful and dissatisfied. These feelings were
rendered morbid in the highest degree, by the
melancholy affliction that assailed him in his later
years. He became nearly deaf, and was consequently
deprived of the dearest enjoyment of a
musician’s life. These feelings were developed, in a
marked degree, in all his purely ideal compositions.
Dark and mysterious strains of harmony would be
succeeded by a burst of wild and melancholy fancy.
Anon a tender, but broad and flowing melody, would
melt the soul by its passionate pathos, but only of
sufficient duration to render the cadence of heart-rending
despair, which succeeds it, the more striking.
Rapid and abrupt modulations, strange and startling
combinations, bore evidence of his wild imagination,
and the uncontrollable impulse of his feelings. The
opera of Fidelio, the only dramatic work that he
ever wrote, ranks only second to Don Giovanni. In
Fidelio each person has a distinct musical character,
so clearly and forcibly marked, that the aid of words
is not necessary to distinguish them. It would be
impossible to transpose them without losing their
identity, and destroying the sense of the music. Mozart’s
genius was tender yet sublime: Beethoven’s
was melancholy, mysterious, yet gigantic. Each
painted himself; each drew from his own bosom all
the inspiration his works exhibited. They required
no outward influence; they needed no adventitious
circumstances to rouse their imagination, or to cause
their thoughts to flow, for in their own souls was an
ever gushing spring of divine melody, that could not
be controlled. They <span class='it'>thought music</span>, and, as light
flows from the sun, gladdening the creation, so their
music came from them, irradiating the hearts of men,
and throwing over them a delicious spell, whose
charm is everlasting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Music is so ethereal, and deals so little in realities,
that its followers, partaking of its characteristics, are
in most instances, impulsive, impassioned and unworldly.
Careless of the excitements and mutations
of the times; unambitious of place or power; indifferent
to the struggles and heart-burnings of party
politicians, from the utter uncongeniality of the feelings
and emotions they engender, with their own,
they live secluded, shut up within their own hearts,
and seldom appear to the world in their true colors,
from the utter impossibility of making it comprehend
or sympathise with their refined and mysterious
feelings. The world has no conception of the exquisite
delight that music confers upon musicians. It
is not mere pleasure; it is not a mere gratification
that can be experienced and forgotten! Oh, no! It
is a blending of the physical with the intellectual; it
softens the nature; it heightens the imagination; it
throws a delicious languor over the whole organization;
it isolates the thoughts, concentrating them
only to listen and receive; it elevates the soul to a
region of its own, until it is faint with breathing the
melodious atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Music is the offspring of these feelings. The inspiration
is the gift of God alone, and cannot be
added to or diminished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one stride came the dark, and it is now night.
Cold and loud is the raging storm. Rain enow and
sleet are dashing most furiously against the windows,—actually
dampening the curtains within. There—there
goes a shutter, torn from its hinges by the
wind! Another gust,—and how desolate its moan!
It is the voice of the Winter Storm Spirit, who comes
from beyond the ice-plains of the North. I can
interpret his cry, which is dismal as the howl of
wolves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mortal crouch—crouch like a worm beside thy
hearth-stone and acknowledge thy insignificance.
When the skies are bright, and thou art surrounded
by the comforts of life, thou goest forth among thy
fellows boasting of thine intellect and greatness.
But when the elements arise, shaking the very earth
to its foundation, thou dost tremble with fear, and thy
boasting is forgotten. Approach the window, and as
thou lookest upon the gloom of this stormy night, learn
a lesson of humility. Thou art in thyself as frail and
helpless as the icicle depending from yonder bough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O, this is a glorious night for me! I have broken
the chains which have bound me in the Arctic Sea,
and fearful elements follow in my path to execute
my bidding. Listen, while I picture to your mind a
few of the countless scenes I have witnessed, which
are terrible to man, but to me a delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An hundred miles away, there is a lonely cottage
on the border of an inland lake. An hour ago
I passed by there, and a mingled sound of woe came
from its inmates, for they were poor and sick, and
had no wood. A miserable starving dog was whining
at their door. I laughed with joy and left them
to their suffering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came to a broad river, where two ferrymen
were toiling painfully at their work. I loosened the
ice that had been formed farther up, and it crushed
them to death in its mad career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beside a mountain, a solitary foot-traveller, of
three score years and ten, was ascending a road
heavily and slow. I chilled the crimson current in
his veins, and the pure white snow became his
winding sheet. What matter! It was his time to
die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On yonder rock-bound coast, a fisherman was
startled from his fireside by a signal of distress. He
looked through the darkness and discovered a noble
ship hastening toward a dangerous reef. I brought
her there, regardless of the costly merchandize and
freight of human life. She struck,—and three hundred
hardy men went down into that black roaring
element which gives not back its dead. The
morrow will dawn, and the child at home will lisp
its father’s name, unconscious of his fate, and the
wife will smile and press her infant to her bosom,
not doubting but that her husband will soon return to
bless her with his love. I have no sympathy with
the widow and the fatherless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hark! did you not hear it?—that dismal shout!
Alas! the deed is done,—the touch of the incendiary
hath kindled a fire such as this city has never beheld.
What rich and glowing color in those clouds
of smoke rising so heavily from yonder turrets!
Already they are changed into an ocean of flame,
hissing and roaring. Unheard, save at intervals, is
the cry of the watchman, and the ringing bells; and
muffled are the hasty footsteps of the thronging
multitude, for the snow is deep. Slowly do the engines
rumble along, while strained to their utmost
are the sinews of those hardy firemen. But useless
is all this noise and labor, for the receptacles of
water are blocked with ice. Fire! fire!! fire!!!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And here endeth the song of Euroclydon, which
was listened to on the 16th of December, 1835. It
will be recollected, that when the sun rose in unclouded
beauty on the following morning, six hundred
buildings had been consumed, many lives lost and
twenty millions of property destroyed.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE EXPEDITION.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was a melancholy day when the body of the
murdered Mr. Neville was deposited in the burial
ground of the port of ——; and if strangers shed
tears at his funeral what must have been the emotions
of his orphaned daughter! All that kindness
could do, however, was done to alleviate her grief;
her friends crowded around her to offer consolation;
and even our hardy tars showed their sympathy
for her by more than one act. It was a fortunate
occurrence that she had a near relative in town,
and in his family accordingly she took up her residence,
where she could indulge her sorrow on the
bosoms of those who were united to her by natural
ties, and could sympathize with her the more sincerely
because they knew the worth of which she
had been deprived. It is one of the wisest dispensations
of Providence that our grief should be shared,
and as it were soothed, by those we love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pirates had no sooner been committed to prison
than endeavors were made, on the part of the
authorities, to ascertain the haunt of the gang; for
its depredations had been carried on during the past
year to an extent that left no doubt that the prisoners
formed only a detachment of a larger body, which,
dividing into different parties, preyed on the commerce
of the surrounding islands, from as many different
points. Where the head-quarters of the pirates
were held was however unknown; as every attempt
to discover them, or even to capture any of the gang
had hitherto proved abortive. The authorities were,
therefore, anxious to get one or more of the prisoners
to reveal the retreat of their messmates on a promise
of pardon; but for some time their efforts were
unavailing, as each prisoner knew, that if any of the
gang escaped, the life of the traitor would not be
worth a moment’s purchase. At length, however,
the temptations held out to two of the prisoners
proved irresistible, and they revealed the secret
which the governor-general was so anxious to know.
The head-quarters of the pirates proved to be on a
small island, some leagues north of the spot where
we captured the prisoners. The place was said to
be admirably fortified by nature, and there was no
doubt, from the prisoners’ confession, that art had
been called in to render the retreat impregnable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The number of the pirates usually left behind to
protect their head-quarters was said to amount to a
considerable force. Notwithstanding these things,
the governor-general resolved on sending a secret
expedition to carry the place and, if possible, make
prisoners of the whole nest of freebooters. As, however,
the spies of the gang were known to infest
the town, it was necessary to carry on the preparations
for the expedition with the utmost caution, so
that no intelligence of the contemplated attack should
reach the pirates to warn them of their danger.
While, therefore, the authorities were apparently
occupied with the approaching trial to the exclusion
of everything else, they were, in fact, secretly making
the most active exertions to fit out an expedition
for the purpose of breaking up the haunts of the
gang. Several vessels were purchased, ostensibly
for private purposes; and soldiers drafted into them,
under the cloud of night. The vessels then left the
harbor, cleared for various ports, with the understanding,
however, that they should all rendezvous
on an appointed day at a cape a few leagues distant
from the retreat of the pirates. So adroitly was the
affair managed, that the various vessels composing
the expedition left the port unsuspected—even high
officers of government who were not admitted to the
secret, regarding them merely as common merchant-men
departing on their several voyages. Indeed,
had an attack been contemplated on a hostile power
the preparations could not have been more secret or
comprehensive. The almost incredible strength of
the piratical force rendered such preparations, however,
not only desirable but necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was one among the few admitted to the secret,
for the governor-general did me the honor to consult
me on several important particulars respecting
the expedition. Tired of the life of inactivity I was
leading, and anxious to see the end of the adventure,
I offered to accompany the enterprise as a volunteer—an
offer which his excellency gladly accepted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We set sail in a trim little brig, disguised as a
merchantman; but as soon as morning dawned and
we had gained an offing, we threw off our disguise,
and presented an armament of six guns on a side,
with a proportionable number of men. Our craft,
indeed, was the heaviest one belonging to the expedition,
and all on board acquainted with her destination
were sanguine of success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind proved favorable, and in less than forty-eight
hours we made Capo del Istri, where the four
vessels composing the expedition were to rendezvous.
As we approached the promontory, we discovered
one after another of the little fleet, for as
we had been the last to leave port, our consorts had
naturally first reached the rendezvous, and in a few
minutes we hove to in the centre of the squadron
hoisting a signal for the respective captains to come
aboard, in order to consult respecting the attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The den of the pirates was situated at the head of
a narrow strait, communicating with a lagoon of
some extent, formed by the waters of a river collecting
in the hollow of three hills, before they discharged
themselves into the sea. Across the mouth
of this lagoon was moored the hull of a dismasted
ship, in such a position that her broadside commanded
the entrance to the lake. Behind, the huts
of the piratical settlement stretched along the shore,
while the various vessels of the freebooters lay anchored
in different positions in the lagoon. Such, at
least, we were told, was the appearance of the place
when the pirates were not absent on their expeditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our plan of attack was soon arranged. It was determined
to divide our forces into two divisions, so
that while one party should attack the pirates in front
the other should take a more circuitous path, and
penetrating by land to the back of the settlement,
take the enemy in the rear. As night was already
closing in, it was determined to disembark the latter
party at once, so that it might proceed, under the
guidance of one of the prisoners, to the position behind
the enemy, and reach there, as near as possible,
at the first dawn of day. It was arranged that the
attack by water should commence an hour or two
before day. By this means each party could reach
its point of attack almost simultaneously. The onset
however was to be first made from the water side,
and the ambuscade in the rear of the foe was not to
show itself until the fight had made some progress
on our side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men destined for the land service were accordingly
mustered and set ashore, under the guidance
of one of the prisoners. We watched their receding
forms through the twilight until they were lost to
view, when we sought our hammocks for a few hours
repose preparatory to what might be our last conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night was yet young, however, when we entered
the mouth of the strait, and with a favorable
breeze sailed along up towards the lagoon. The
shallowness of the water in the channel had compelled
us to leave our two larger craft behind and
our forces were consequently crowded into the remaining
vessels. Neither of these carried a broadside
of weight sufficient to cope with that of the hull
moored across the mouth of the lagoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we advanced up the strait a death-like stillness
reigned on its shadowy shores; and we had nearly
reached the mouth of the lagoon before any sign
betokened that the pirates were aware of our approach.
We could just catch sight of the tall rakish
masts of a schooner over the low tree tops on the
right, when a gun was heard in the direction of the
lagoon, whether accidently fired or not we could not
tell. We listened attentively for a repetition of the
sound; but it came not. Could it have been a careless
discharge from our own friends in the rear of
the foe, or was it a warning fired by one of the
pirates’ sentinels? Five or ten minutes elapsed,
however, and all was silent. Meantime our vessels,
with a wind free over the taffrail, were stealing
almost noiselessly along the smooth surface of the
strait; while the men lying close at their quarters,
fully armed for the combat, breathlessly awaited the
moment of attack, the intenseness of their excitement
increasing as the period approached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My own emotions I will not attempt to pourtray.
We were already within a cable’s length of the end
of the strait, and in rounding-to into the lagoon we
would if our approach had been detected, have to
run the gauntlet of the broadside of the craft guarding
this approach to the pirates’ den—a broadside
which if well delivered would in all probability send
us to the bottom. Our peril was indeed imminent.
And the uncertainty whether our approach had been
detected or not created a feeling of nervous suspense
which increased our sensation of our peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A minute more and we shall shoot by the pirate,”
said I to the captain of our craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay!” said he, “I have just passed the word for
the men to lie down under the shelter of the bulwarks,
so that if they pour a fire of musketry into
us, we shall escape it as much as possible. Let us
follow their example.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We sheltered ourselves just forward of the wheel-house,
so that as the vessel came around on the starboard
tack, no living individual was left standing on
the deck, except the helmsman. The next moment,
leaving the shelter of the high bank, we swept into
the lagoon, and saw the dark hull of the opposing
vessel moored directly across our way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our suspense however was soon brought to a close.
We had scarcely come abreast of the enemy’s broadside
when, as if by magic, her port-holes were thrown
open, and as the blaze of the battle lanterns streamed
across the night, her guns were run out and instantaneously
her fire was poured out from stem to stern
in one continuous sheet of flame. Our mainmast
went at once by the board; our hull was fearfully
cut up; and the shrieks of the wounded of our crew
rose up in terrible discord as the roar of the broadside
died away. But we still had headway. Springing
to his feet the captain shouted to cut away the
hamper that dragged the mainmast by our side.
His orders were instantly obeyed. The schooner
was once more headed for the hulk, and with a loud
cheer our men sprang to their guns, while our consort
behind opened her fire at the same moment.
Our light armament however was almost wholly inefficient.
But happily we had not relied on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lay her aboard!” shouted the captain, “boarders
away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the word, amid the fire of a renewed broadside
we dashed up to the foe, and running her afoul just
abaft of the mizzen-chains, poured our exasperated
men like a torrent upon her decks. I was one of
the first to mount her bulwarks. Attacked thus at
their very guns the pirates rallied desperately to the
defence, and a furious combat ensued. I remember
striking eagerly for a moment or two in the very
thickest of the fight, and then feeling a sharp pain in
my side, as a pistol went off beside me. I have a
faint recollection of sinking to the deck, but after
that all is a void.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>PART II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The two winters that I spent at West Point,
though long and cold, were by no means tedious. Secluded
as we were from the rest of the world, while
the river was locked up in ice, still we contrived
amusements for ourselves, and had much enjoyment
in our own way. The society of the place, though
not large, was excellent. And in the evening (the best
time for social intercourse) almost every member of
our little circle was either out visiting, or at home
entertaining visiters. There were reading-parties that
assembled every Thursday night at the respective
houses—the ladies bringing their work, and the gentlemen
their books. The gentlemen had also weekly
chess-parties, of ten or twelve chess-players and five
or six chess-boards. They met at an early hour, and
no ladies being present, they seriously set to work
at this absorbing game—the solemnities being interrupted
only by a <span class='it'>petit souper</span> at ten o’clock,—after
which they resumed their chess, and frequently took
no note of time till near midnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the second winter of my abode at West Point,
we had a series of regular subscription-balls, held in
the large up-stairs room of the mess hall—the expense
being defrayed by the officers and professors.
On the first of these evenings the ground was hard
frozen, but as yet no snow had fallen. The managers
had notified that the ladies were all to ride to
the ball. We were at a loss to conjecture where
they would find conveyances for us—and we were
not Cinderellas with convenient fairy-godmothers to
transform pumpkins into coaches. An omnibus
would have been a glorious acquisition—but at that
time there was nothing on West Point in the shape
of a wheeled carriage, with the exception of the
doctor’s gig. This vehicle was pressed into the service—and
having great duty to perform, it commenced
its trips at a very early hour, actually calling
for the first lady at five o’clock in the afternoon—and
from that time it was continually coming and
going like a short stage. At last, by way of expediting
the business, they thought proper to adopt, as an
auxiliary to the gig, another conveyance not of the
most dignified character. But then nobody saw us but
ourselves—and newspaper correspondents had not
yet begun to come up to West Point to forage among
us in quest of food for their columns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My sister-in-law and myself had not quite finished
dressing, when we heard my brother down stairs
calling to our man to know why he had thrown open
the large gate?—“To let in the cart, sir, to take the
ladies to the ball”—was Richard’s reply. And, true
enough, we found at the door a real <span class='it'>bonâ fide</span> open
cart, having its flooring covered with straw. In it
were some rather inelegant chairs, upon which my
sister and I seated ourselves, like a couple of market-women.
My brother having assisted us in,
seemed to think it unofficer-like conduct to ride in a
cart, and therefore, preferred walking—which, however,
was no great fatigue, the distance being only
a few furlongs from the house in which we then
lived to the mess hall. The driver perched himself
on the edge of the front board—and after a few steps
of the horse, each accompanied by one jolt and two
creaks, we were safely transported to the ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately, before the next <span class='it'>soirée de danse</span> the
ground was covered with a deep snow; and the
sleighing was excellent during the remainder of the
winter. As sleighs were singularly plenty on West
Point, and as a sleigh has the faculty of holding
ladies <span class='it'>ad libitum</span>, the company was conveyed very
expeditiously to the subsequent balls. This mode of
transportation was found so convenient, that at
the close of the season, (which was not till late in
March,) though the snow had all disappeared and the
ground was clear, the sleighs were still kept in requisition;
and we went to the last ball sleighing upon
nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I well remember being at a New Year’s ball given
by the cadets. This also took place in the large
upper room of the mess hall. The decorations
(which were the best the place and the season could
furnish) were planned and executed entirely by those
young gentlemen. For several previous days they
had devoted their leisure-time to cutting and bringing
in an immense quantity of evergreens, with which
they festooned the walls, and converted every one of
the numerous windows into a sort of bower, by
arching it from the top to the floor with an impervious
mass of thickly-woven foliage. The pillars that supported
the ceiling were each encircled by muskets
with very bright bayonets. The orchestra for the
music was constructed of the national flag that belonged
to the post. This flag, which, when flying out
from the top of its lofty staff, looks at that height
scarcely more than a yard or two in length, is, in
reality, so large, that when taken down two men are
required to carry it away in its voluminous folds. On
this occasion the drapery of the stars and stripes was
ingeniously disposed, so as to form something like a
stage-box with a canopy over it. The two elegant
standards that had been presented to the corps of cadets
by the hands of ladies, were fancifully and gracefully
suspended between the central pillars, and waved
over the heads of the dancers. Affixed to the walls
were numerous lights in sconces, decorated with
wreaths of the mountain-laurel whose leaves are
green all winter. These sconces were merely of tin,
made very bright for the occasion; but they were the
same that had been used at the ball given, while our
army lay at West Point, by the American to the
French officers, in honor of the birth of the dauphin.
For this camp-like entertainment, the soldiers erected
on the plain, a sort of pavilion or arbor of immense
length covered in with laurel branches, and illuminated
by these simple lamps, which afterwards became
valuable as revolutionary relics. They have
ever since been taken care of, in the military store-house
belonging to West Point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this memorable ball whose courtesies were emblematic
of the national feeling, and which was intended
to assist in strengthening the bonds of alliance between
the regal government of France and the first
congress of America, the ladies of many of our continental
officers were present: having travelled to
West Point for the purpose—and in the dance that
commenced the festivities of the evening, the lady
of General Knox led off as the partner of Washington.
In all probability the commander-in-chief, with
his fine figure and always graceful deportment, was
in early life an excellent dancer, according to the
fashion of those times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Undoubtedly the intelligence of this complimentary
entertainment was received with pleasure by Louis
the Sixteenth and his beautiful Antoinette. Little
did these unfortunate sovereigns surmise that those of
their own subjects who participated in the festivities
of that night, would return to France so imbued
with republican principles as to lend their aid in
overturning the throne;—that throne whose foundation
had already been undermined by the crimes and
vices of the two preceding monarchs. Few were
the years that intervened between the emancipation
of America, and that tremendous period when
the brilliant court of Versailles was swept away by
the hands of an infuriated people; its “princes and
lords” either flying into exile or perishing on the
scaffold. And, idolized as they had been at the commencement
of their eventful reign, the son of St.
Louis and the daughter of the Cæsars were relentlessly
consigned to a dreary captivity terminated by
a bloody death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dauphin, whose birth was thus honored in the
far-off land which his royal father was assisting in
her contest for liberty, died, happily for himself, in
early childhood; thus, escaping the miseries that were
heaped upon the unfortunate boy who succeeded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The West Point balls seem to have peculiar
charms for strangers, particularly if these strangers
are young ladies, and it is a pleasure to the residents
of the place to see them enjoy the novelty of the
scene. The fair visiters are always delighted with
the decorations of the room, with the chivalric gallantry
of the officers and cadets, and still more with
the circumstance of all their partners being in uniform.
To those who are not “to the manner born,”
there is something very dazzling in the shine of a
military costume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the New Year’s ball to which I have alluded,
among other invited guests was a party that came
over in an open boat from the opposite side of the
Hudson, notwithstanding that the weather was intensely
cold, the sky threatening a snow-storm, and
the river almost impassable from the accumulating
ice. The young ladies belonging to this party were
certainly valuable acquisitions to the company, as
they were handsome, sprightly, beautifully drest, and
excellent dancers. I particularly recollect one of
them—a tall, fair, fine-looking girl, attired in white
satin with an upper dress of transparent pink zephyr,
the skirt and sleeves looped up with small white
roses. Her figure was set off to great advantage by
an extremely well-fitting boddice of pale pink satin,
laced in front with white silk cord and tassels—and
a spray of white roses looked out among the plats
that were enwreathed at the back of her finely-formed
head. This young lady and her friends seemed to
enter <span class='it'>con amore</span> into the enjoyment of the scene and
the dance. But their pleasure was dearly purchased.
As they had made arrangements to return home that
night, after twelve o’clock, when the ball was over,
they could not be persuaded to remain at West
Point till the following day. They embarked with
the gentlemen who belonged to their party. At daylight
their boat was descried in the middle of the
river. It was completely blocked up by the ice that
had gathered round it, and in this manner they had
passed the cold and dreary remainder of the night
whose first part had afforded them so much enjoyment.
A boat was immediately sent out from West
Point to their rescue, and the ladies were found benumbed
with cold, and indeed nearly dead. The
ice was cut away with axes brought for the purpose,
they were released from their perilous condition, and
with much difficulty the passage to the other side of
the river was finally achieved. After the ladies
had recovered from the effects of so many hours severe
suffering, they were said to have declared that
they would willingly go through a repetition of the
same for the sake of another such ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My compassion was much excited by a <span class='it'>contre-tems</span>
that happened to certain fair young strangers from
New York, whom I found in the dressing-room at
the close of one of the summer balls annually given
by the cadets about the last of August, on the eve of
the day in which they break up their encampment,
and return to their usual residence in the barracks.
The above-mentioned young ladies had come up from
the city that evening, in consequence of invitations
sent down to them a week before. By some unaccountable
oversight either of themselves or of the
gentlemen that escorted them, the trunks or boxes
containing their ball-room paraphernalia, instead of
being landed on the wharf at West Point had been
left on board the steam-boat, and had gone up to Albany.
As it was a rainy evening, these young ladies
(four or five in number) had embarked in their very
worst dresses, which they considered quite good
enough for the crowd and damp and heat of the
ladies’ cabin, in whose uncomfortable precincts the
bad weather would compel them to seclude themselves
during their voyage of three or four hours.
They did not discover that their baggage was missing
till after their arrival at the dressing-room, supposing
that the trunks were coming after them up-stairs.
Here they had remained the whole evening,
and all they knew of the ball and its anticipated
pleasures was the sound of the music from below
as it imperfectly reached them; the shaking of the
windows as the floor vibrated under the feet of the
dancers; and a glance at the dresses of the ladies as
they came up when the ball was over, to muffle
themselves in their shawls and calashes. None
of the distressed damsels had sufficient courage to
go down to the ball-room in their dishabille, and sit
there as spectators: though much importuned to do
so by their unlucky beaux. I give this little anecdote
as an admonition to my youthful readers to take
especial care that their baggage does not give them
the slip when they are travelling to a ball.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cadets are remarkably clever at getting up
fancy-balls, and in dressing and sustaining whatever
characters they then assume. The corps being composed
of miscellaneous young gentlemen from every
section of the Union, each is <span class='it'>au fait</span> to the peculiar
characteristics of the common people that he has seen
in his native place—and they represent them with
much truth and humor. There will be, for instance, a
hunter from the far west; a Yankee pedlar with his
tins and other “notions;” an assortment of Tuckahoes,
Buckeyes, Hooshers, Wolverines, &amp;c.; and
also a good proportion of Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At one of these fancy-balls the squeak of a bad
fife (or perhaps of a good fife badly played on) and
the tuck of an ill-braced drum, was heard ascending
the stair-case followed by an irregular tramp of feet
and the chatter of many voices. The door (which
had been recently closed) was now thrown open
with a bang, and a militia company, personated by
a number of the choicest cadets, came marching in,
with a step that set all time and tune at defiance;
some trudging, some ambling, and some striding.
They were headed by a captain who, compared to
Uncle Sam’s officers, certainly wore his regimentals
“with a difference.” Having “marshalled his clan,”
whom he arranged with a picturesque intermixture
of tall and short, and in a line partaking of the serpentine,
he put them through their exercise in a
manner so laughably bad as could only have been
enacted by persons who knew perfectly well what it
ought to be. Their firelocks were rough sticks, cornstalks,
and shut umbrellas—and when the captain
was calling the muster-roll, the names to which his
men answered were ludicrous in the extreme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have before alluded to the West Point Band,
which must always be classed among the most
agreeable recollections connected with that place;
particularly by those who were familiar with its excellence
when Willis was the instructor in military
music. He was an Irishman, and had belonged to
the lord lieutenant’s band at Dublin Castle. His own
exquisite performance on the Kent bugle can never
be forgotten by any one who has been so fortunate
as to hear it; and he taught all the members of the
West Point Band to play on their respective instruments
in the most admirable manner. One of them,
named Ford, excelled on the octave flute. Sometimes
when, on a moonlight summer evening, they
were playing under the beautiful elms that are clustered
in front of the mess house, and delighting us
with a charming composition called the Nightingale,
Ford would ascend one of the trees, and seated
amidst its branches, perform solo on his flute those
passages that imitated the warbling of the bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Occasionally a distinguished vocalist came to
West Point for the purpose of having a concert;
and these concerts were always well attended. On
one of the concert nights, Willis accompanied Keene
(a celebrated singer of that time) in the fine martial
air of the Last Bugle—a beautiful song beginning,</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“When the muffled drum sounds the last march of the brave.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>As each verse finished with, “When he hears the
last bugle,” Willis sounded the bugle in a manner
which seemed almost a foretaste of the muse of another
world. “When he hears the last bugle”—is
again repeated, and the bugle accompaniment is
lower and still sweeter. But at the concluding
words, “When he hears the last bugle he’ll stand to
his arms”—the loud, exulting and melodious tones
of the noble instrument came out in all their fullness
of sound, with an effect that elicited the most rapturous
applause, and which words cannot describe
nor imagination conceive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How much is the beauty of music assisted by the
beauty of poetry. Shame on selfish composers and
conceited performers who, “wishing all the interest
to centre in themselves,” assert that the words of a
song are of no consequence, and that if good, they
only divert the attention of the hearers from the
music—Milton thought otherwise when (himself a
fine musician) he speaks of the double charms of
“music married to immortal verse.” As well might
we say that it was a disadvantage for a handsome
woman to possess a fine figure, lest it should render
the beauty of her face less conspicuous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Music affords additional delight when, it accompanies
the recollection of some interesting fact; or
of some fanciful and vivid allusion connected with
romance, that idol of the young and enthusiastic.
Among the numerous accounts of the peninsular
war which have been given to the world by English
officers, I was much struck by a little incident that
I once read in a description of the entrance of Wellington’s
army into France while expelling the French
from Spain and following them into their own land
beyond the Pyrenees. The first division of the
English troops had at length reached the frontier.
After a day of toilsome march the regiment to which
our author belonged encamped for the night in the
far-famed valley of Roncevalles, where a thousand
years before the army of Charlemagne in attempting
the invasion of Spain, had been driven back by the
Spanish Moors and defeated with great slaughter,
and the loss of his best and noblest paladins, including
“Roland brave, and Olivier.” The mind of our
narrator was carried back to the chivalrous days of
the dark ages, and he might almost have listened for</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was a clear cool evening—the sun had sunk
behind the hills—the roll had been called, the sentinels
posted, and the band of the regiment was playing.
The English officer, imbued with the subject
of his reverie, advanced to request of its leader that
beautiful air</p>

<p class='noindent'>when he was unexpectedly anticipated by one of
his companions in arms, another young officer whose
thoughts had been running in the same channel, and
who had stepped forward before him with the same
request. The wild and melancholy notes of Lewis’s
popular song now rose upon the still evening air, on
the very same spot where ten centuries ago the battle
that it lamented, had been fought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the West Point Band I have frequently heard
music of a soft and touching character played with
a taste and pathos that almost drew tears from the
hearers—for instance, the sad but charming Scottish
air,</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have heard Willis say, that after the publication
of the Irish melodies was planned, he was engaged
by Moore and Sir John Stevenson, to travel in bye
roads and remote places among the peasantry, for the
purpose of collecting from them all the songs and tunes
peculiar to their country. He frequently passed the
night in their cabins, where he was always hospitably
received, and where he was liked the better for making
himself at home among the people; singing new
songs for <span class='it'>them</span>, (he was a good singer) and inducing
them to sing him old ones in return. So that in this
way he caught a great number of national airs, which
were then new to him, and which he afterwards put
in score. It was for these melodies that the minstrel
of Ireland wrote those exquisite songs, on which he
may rest his fairest claim to immortality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Willis was himself an excellent composer of
military music. While at West Point he produced
a number of very fine marches and quicksteps,
usually calling them after the officers. Those denominated
General Swift’s March, and Lieutenant
Blaney’s Quickstep, were perhaps the best. To
some he did not even take the trouble to affix a title,
but distinguished them by numbers. Sometimes
when we sent out to ask the name of “that fine new
march or quickstep that the band had just played,”
he would reply that it was No. 12 or No. 16. The
officers often suggested to him the publication of these
admirable pieces as a source of profit to himself, and
of pleasure to the community; but with his habitual
carelessness of his own interest, he always neglected
taking any steps for the purpose. There is reason
to fear that few or no copies of them are now in existence:
and therefore they will be lost for ever to
the admirers of martial music. Willis lived about
twelve years at West Point, and died there of a lingering
illness in 1830.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the manager of the Park Theatre was getting
up a new musical piece or reviving an old one, he
generally borrowed Willis, for a few of the first evenings,
to play in the orchestra. On one of these occasions
he took down with him to New York his two
little boys, neither of whom had ever been in a theatre.
Mr. Simpson, the manager, allotted them seats
in his private box over one of the stage doors. Both
the children had been instructed by their father, and
sung very well. The after piece was O’Keefe’s little
opera of Sprigs of Laurel. In the duett between the
two rival soldiers, in which each in his turn celebrates
the charms of Mary, the major’s daughter, one
of the boys on hearing the symphony, exclaimed to
his brother—“Why Jem! that’s our duett—the very
last we’ve been practising.” “So it is,” replied
Jem, “let’s join in and sing it with them.” Unconscious
of such a proceeding being the least out
of rule, they united their voices to those of the two
actors, and went through the song with them in perfect
time and tune. The soldiers were amazed at
this unexpected addition to their duett, but looking
up, soon found from whence the sound proceeded.
Willis (who was in the orchestra) became greatly
disconcerted, and in vain made signs to his children
to cease. Their attention was too much engaged to
perceive his displeasure. The audience were not
long in discovering the young singers, and loudly
applauded them, equally pleased with the <span class='it'>naïveté</span> of
the boys and their proficiency in vocalism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was formerly customary for the West Point band
to play sacred music every Sunday morning, in the
camp, after the guard was marched off.</p>

church, public worship was held in the large room designated
as the chapel. The chaplains of the United
States Military Academy, like the chaplain of congress,
may be chosen from the clergy of any denomination.
But as their congregation consists of persons from
every part of the union, and of every religious denomination,
according to the faith in which they have been
educated by their parents, it is understood that the
pastor will have sufficient good taste, or rather good
sense, to refrain from all attempts to advance the
peculiar doctrines of his own immediate sect. After
the officers and professors have all come in and taken
their appropriate seats, the cadets make their entrance
in a body, and occupy the benches allotted to
them. I was one Sunday at the chapel, when five
graduates, or ex-cadets, all of whom had recently
been honored with commissions in the engineers,
came in together, habited in their new uniforms, (that
of the engineers is the handsomest in the army,) and
for the first time took their seats with the officers. I
could have said with Sterne—“Oh! how I envied
them their feelings!” One of these young gentlemen
was a Jew; and as I looked at him that day, I
hoped he was grateful to the God of Abraham for
having cast his lot in a country where the Hebrew
faith can be no impediment to advancement in any
profession either civil or military. Are “the wanderers
of Israel,” who still have so much to contend
with in the old world, sufficiently aware of the advantages
they would derive from changing their
residence to the new?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a custom among the cadets, after they have
completed their course of study, obtained their commissions
as lieutenants, and received orders for repairing
to their respective posts, to have a farewell-meeting
previous to their departure from West Point.
At this meeting it is understood that all offences,
bickerings and animosities, which may have arisen
among them during their four years intercourse as
fellow-students, are to be consigned to oblivion. The
hand of friendship is given all round, and before their
separation they exchange rings which have been
made for this express purpose, all of the same pattern.
These rings they are to retain through life, as
mementoes of “Auld lang syne,” and as pledges of
kind feelings under whatever circumstances, and in
whatever part of the world they may meet hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the numerous benefits which this noble
institution has conferred on the community, is that of
creating attachment and diffusing friendship among
so many young men from different sections of our
widely-extended country, and belonging to different
classes in society. The military academy has made
gentlemen of many intelligent youths, sprung from
the humbler grades of our people. It has made <span class='it'>men</span>
of many scions of high estate, whose talents would
otherwise have been smothered under the follies of
fashion and the enervations of luxury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that kindness and consideration for females,
which is one of the brightest gems in the American
character, none can exceed the cadets and officers of
the American army. Were I to relate all that I
know on this subject I could fill a volume. For instance,
I could tell of a young gentleman from Albany
who out of his pay as a cadet, (twenty-eight dollars a
month,) saved enough to defray the expenses of his
sister’s education, during four years of economy and
self-denial to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the southern bank of the river, beyond the picturesque
spot designated as Kosciusko’s garden, the
shore for some miles continues woody and precipitous,
down to the Kinsley farm-house, a mile or two
below. The path along these rocks was narrow,
rugged, dark and dangerous. In some places it was
impeded by trees growing so close together, and so
near the verge of the precipice that it was expedient
in passing along to cling to their trunks, or to catch
hold of their lower branches, as a support against the
danger of falling down the rocks that impended over
the river. Yet with all its perils and difficulties this
was an interesting walk to any lover of nature in her
rudest aspects. There were wild vines and wild
roses, and the trees were so old and lofty, and their
shade so solemn and impervious. And at their roots
grew clusters of ephemeral plants, of the fungus
tribe it is true, but glowing with the most brilliant
colors, yellow, orange, scarlet and crimson, often
diversified with a group that was white as snow.
Sometimes we saw a lizard of the finest verditer-green,
gliding among the blocks of granite; and
sometimes on hearing a slight chattering above our
heads, we looked up and saw the squirrel as he</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In the decline of a beautiful afternoon when “the
sun was hasting to the west,” and the sweet notes
of the wood-thrush had already began “to hymn the
fading fires of day,” I set out on a walk accompanied
by two young ladies from Philadelphia, whom
in our daily rambles I had already guided to some of
the most popular places on West Point. Having
found that my youthful friends were fearless scramblers
“over bush and over brier,” I proposed that
our walk to-day should be in this narrow pathway
through these rocky woods, or rather along these
woody rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We proceeded accordingly—and our dangers and
difficulties seemed to increase the enjoyment of my
young companions. At length we suddenly emerged
into a spot where the open sunshine denoted that,
since my last walk in this direction, many of the
trees had been cut away. About this little clearing
we found eight or ten men busily at work with
spades and pick-axes. I was struck at once with
the excellent aspect of their habiliments, though
their coats were off and hanging on the bushes and
low rocks around them. We stopped, and I turned
to one of my companions, and was about remarking
to her, “what a happiness it was to live in a country
where the common laboring men were enabled to
make so respectable an appearance, and even while
engaged at their work to wear clothes that were
perfectly whole, and as clean as if put on fresh that
day.” While I was making this observation in a
low voice, the men perceived us; and they all ceased
work, and several stood leaning on their spades,
looking much disconcerted. They consulted a little
together and then one of the foresters advanced, as if
to speak to us. The two young ladies, seized with a
sudden panic, hastily ran back into the woods. He
came up and addressed me by name, and I immediately
recognised an officer who visited intimately at
my brother’s house. On looking at his comrades, I
found that I knew them every one; and that they
were all gentlemen belonging to West Point. They
seemed much, though needlessly, confused at being
detected by ladies in their present occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gentleman who had come forward made
some remarks on the inconveniences we must have
encountered during our rugged walk, and he directed
us to a way of going home that, though longer and
more circuitous, would be less difficult. My young
friends now ventured out from their retreat; I introduced
them to the officer who had been talking to
me, and leaving him with his comrades to pursue
their work, we found our way home by the road that
he indicated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening the same gentleman made one of
his accustomed visits at my brother’s, and explained
to us the scene of the afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain H——, was the only surviving child of an
aged and widowed mother, the sister of a distinguished
general-officer in the revolutionary army. Her son,
a graduate of the Military Academy, was afterwards
stationed at West Point; and he then went to Vermont
and brought his mother that they might live
near each other. His own apartments being in one
of the barracks, he took lodgings for Mrs. H⁠——, at
a quiet farm-house in the vicinity: and devoted
nearly all his leisure-time to her society. The old
lady sometimes came up to visit her son in his rooms
at the barracks, to see that he was comfortable there,
and keep his ward-robe in order. The nearest way
from her residence to the plain, was along the dark
and rugged forest path on the edge of the rocks; and
this was the road she always came. The captain
wishing to make it more easy and less dangerous for
his mother, set about doing so with his own hands.
He had already made some progress in this work of
filial affection, when he was discovered by several of
his brother officers; they mentioned it to others, and
they all immediately volunteered to assist him in his
praise-worthy undertaking. They assembled of afternoons
for this purpose, (which they endeavored to
keep as secret as possible) and it was now about half
accomplished; having been commenced at the end
nearest to Mrs. H⁠——’s residence. In consequence
of this explanation, by the captain’s friend, we took
care not to interrupt them by walking in that direction,
till after the work was completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They cut down trees, cleared away bushes, removed
masses of stone, levelled banks, filled up hollows,
and paved quagmires: leading the path to a
safe distance from the ledge of rocks. A fine convenient
road was soon completed, and the old lady
was enabled to visit the captain without difficulty or
danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grave has long since closed over that mother,
and the military station of her son has been changed
to a place far distant from West Point. But the
pathway commenced by filial affection, and finished
with the assistance of friendship is still there, forming
a convenient and beautiful walk through the
woods to the farm-house and its vicinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is known by all the inhabitants of West Point as
the Officer’s Road; and long may it continue to bear
that title.</p>

<div><h1><a id='rev'></a>REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS.</h1></div>

<hr class='tbk126'/>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Twice-Told Tales. By Nathaniel Hawthorne. Two Volumes.
Boston: James Munroe and Co.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We said a few hurried words about Mr. Hawthorne in
our last number, with the design of speaking more fully in
the present. We are still, however, pressed for room, and
must necessarily discuss his volumes more briefly and
more at random than their high merits deserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The book professes to be a collection of <span class='it'>tales</span>, yet is, in
two respects, misnamed. These pieces are now in their
third republication, and, of course, are thrice-told. Moreover,
they are by no means <span class='it'>all</span> tales, either in the ordinary
or in the legitimate understanding of the term. Many of
them are pure essays, for example, “Sights from a
Steeple,” “Sunday at Home,” “Little Annie’s Ramble,”
“A Rill from the Town-Pump,” “The Toll-Gatherer’s
Day,” “The Haunted Mind,” “The Sister Years,”
“Snow-Flakes,” “Night Sketches,” and “Foot-Prints on
the Sea-Shore.” We mention these matters chiefly on
account of their discrepancy with that marked precision
and finish by which the body of the work is distinguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the Essays just named, we must be content to speak
in brief. They are each and all beautiful, without being
characterised by the polish and adaptation so visible in the
tales proper. A painter would at once note their leading
or predominant feature, and style it <span class='it'>repose</span>. There is no
attempt at effect. All is quiet, thoughtful, subdued. Yet
this repose may exist simultaneously with high originality
of thought; and Mr. Hawthorne has demonstrated the fact.
At every turn we meet with novel combinations, yet these
combinations never surpass the limits of the quiet. We
are soothed as we read; and withal is a calm astonishment
that ideas so apparently obvious have never occurred or
been presented to us before. Herein our author differs
materially from Lamb or Hunt or Hazlitt—who, with vivid
originality of manner and expression, have less of the
true novelty of thought than is generally supposed, and
whose originality, at best, has an uneasy and meretricious
quaintness, replete with startling effects unfounded in
nature, and inducing trains of reflection which lead to no
satisfactory result. The Essays of Hawthorne have much
of the character of Irving, with more of originality, and
less of finish; while, compared with the Spectator, they
have a vast superiority at all points. The Spectator, Mr.
Irving, and Mr. Hawthorne have in common that tranquil
and subdued manner which we have chosen to denominate
<span class='it'>repose</span>; but, in the case of the two former, this repose is
attained rather by the absence of novel combination, or of
originality, than otherwise, and consists chiefly in the
calm, quiet, unostentatious expression of commonplace
thoughts, in an unambitious unadulterated Saxon. In
them, by strong effort, we are made to conceive the absence
of all. In the essays before us the absence of effort is too
obvious to be mistaken, and a strong under-current of <span class='it'>suggestion</span>
runs continuously beneath the upper stream of the
tranquil thesis. In short, these effusions of Mr. Hawthorne
are the product of a truly imaginative intellect, restrained,
and in some measure repressed, by fastidiousness of taste,
by constitutional melancholy and by indolence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is of his tales that we desire principally to speak.
The tale proper, in our opinion, affords unquestionably the
fairest field for the exercise of the loftiest talent, which can
be afforded by the wide domains of mere prose. Were we
bidden to say how the highest genius could be most advantageously
employed for the best display of its own powers,
we should answer, without hesitation—in the composition
of a rhymed poem, not to exceed in length what might be
perused in an hour. Within this limit alone can the highest
order of true poetry exist. We need only here say,
upon this topic, that, in almost all classes of composition,
the unity of effect or impression is a point of the greatest
importance. It is clear, moreover, that this unity cannot
be thoroughly preserved in productions whose perusal cannot
be completed at one sitting. We may continue the
reading of a prose composition, from the very nature of
prose itself, much longer than we can persevere, to any
good purpose, in the perusal of a poem. This latter, if
truly fulfilling the demands of the poetic sentiment, induces
an exaltation of the soul which cannot be long sustained.
All high excitements are necessarily transient. Thus a
long poem is a paradox. And, without unity of impression,
the deepest effects cannot be brought about. Epics were
the offspring of an imperfect sense of Art, and their reign is
no more. A poem <span class='it'>too</span> brief may produce a vivid, but never
an intense or enduring impression. Without a certain
continuity of effort—without a certain duration or repetition
of purpose—the soul is never deeply moved. There
must be the dropping of the water upon the rock. De
Béranger has wrought brilliant things—pungent and spirit-stirring—but,
like all immassive bodies, they lack <span class='it'>momentum</span>,
and thus fail to satisfy the Poetic Sentiment. They
sparkle and excite, but, from want of continuity, fail deeply
to impress. Extreme brevity will degenerate into epigrammatism;
but the sin of extreme length is even more unpardonable.
<span class='it'>In medio tutissimus ibis.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Were we called upon however to designate that class of
composition which, next to such a poem as we have suggested,
should best fulfil the demands of high genius—should
offer it the most advantageous field of exertion—we
should unhesitatingly speak of the prose tale, as Mr. Hawthorne
has here exemplified it. We allude to the short
prose narrative, requiring from a half-hour to one or two
hours in its perusal. The ordinary novel is objectionable,
from its length, for reasons already stated in substance.
As it cannot be read at one sitting, it deprives itself, of
course, of the immense force derivable from <span class='it'>totality</span>.
Worldly interests intervening during the pauses of perusal,
modify, annul, or counteract, in a greater or less degree,
the impressions of the book. But simple cessation in reading
would, of itself, be sufficient to destroy the true unity.
In the brief tale, however, the author is enabled to carry
out the fulness of his intention, be it what it may. During
the hour of perusal the soul of the reader is at the writer’s
control. There are no external or extrinsic influences—resulting
from weariness or interruption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A skilful literary artist has constructed a tale. If wise,
he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommodate his incidents;
but having conceived, with deliberate care, a certain
unique or single <span class='it'>effect</span> to be wrought out, he then invents
such incidents—he then combines such events as may
best aid him in establishing this preconceived effect. If his
very initial sentence tend not to the outbringing of this
effect, then he has failed in his first step. In the whole
composition there should be no word written, of which the
tendency, direct or indirect, is not to the one pre-established
design. And by such means, with such care and skill, a
picture is at length painted which leaves in the mind of
him who contemplates it with a kindred art, a sense of the
fullest satisfaction. The idea of the tale has been presented
unblemished, because undisturbed; and this is an end
unattainable by the novel. Undue brevity is just as
exceptionable here as in the poem, but undue length is yet
more to be avoided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have said that the tale has a point of superiority
even over the poem. In fact, while the <span class='it'>rhythm</span> of this
latter is an essential aid in the development of the poem’s
highest idea—the idea of the Beautiful—the artificialities of
this rhythm are an inseparable bar to the development of
all points of thought or expression which have their basis
in <span class='it'>Truth</span>. But Truth is often, and in very great degree,
the aim of the tale. Some of the finest tales are tales of
ratiocination. Thus the field of this species of composition,
if not in so elevated a region on the mountain of Mind, is a
table-land of far vaster extent than the domain of the mere
poem. Its products are never so rich, but infinitely more
numerous, and more appreciable by the mass of mankind.
The writer of the prose tale, in short, may bring to his theme
a vast variety of modes or inflections of thought and expression—(the
ratiocinative, for example, the sarcastic or
the humorous) which are not only antagonistical to the
nature of the poem, but absolutely forbidden by one of its
most peculiar and indispensable adjuncts; we allude of
course, to rhythm. It may be added, here, <span class='it'>par parenthèse</span>,
that the author who aims at the purely beautiful in a prose
tale is laboring at great disadvantage. For Beauty can be
better treated in the poem. Not so with terror, or passion,
or horror, or a multitude of such other points. And here it
will be seen how full of prejudice are the usual animadversions
against those <span class='it'>tales of effect</span> many fine examples of
which were found in the earlier numbers of Blackwood.
The impressions produced were wrought in a legitimate
sphere of action, and constituted a legitimate although
sometimes an exaggerated interest. They were relished
by every man of genius: although there were found many
men of genius who condemned them without just ground.
The true critic will but demand that the design intended be
accomplished, to the fullest extent, by the means most advantageously
applicable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have very few American tales of real merit—we
may say, indeed, none, with the exception of “The Tales
of a Traveller” of Washington Irving, and these “Twice-Told
Tales” of Mr. Hawthorne. Some of the pieces of
Mr. John Neal abound in vigor and originality; but in general,
his compositions of this class are excessively diffuse,
extravagant, and indicative of an imperfect sentiment of
Art. Articles at random are, now and then, met with in
our periodicals which might be advantageously compared
with the best effusions of the British Magazines; but, upon
the whole, we are far behind our progenitors in this department
of literature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of Mr. Hawthorne’s Tales we would say, emphatically,
that they belong to the highest region of Art—an Art subservient
to genius of a very lofty order. We had supposed,
with good reason for so supposing, that he had been thrust
into his present position by one of the impudent <span class='it'>cliques</span>
which beset our literature, and whose pretensions it is our
full purpose to expose at the earliest opportunity; but
we have been most agreeably mistaken. We know of few
compositions which the critic can more honestly commend
than these “Twice-Told Tales.” As Americans, we
feel proud of the book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Hawthorne’s distinctive trait is invention, creation,
imagination, originality—a trait which, in the literature of
fiction, is positively worth all the rest. But the nature of
originality, so far as regards its manifestation in letters, is
but imperfectly understood. The inventive or original
mind as frequently displays itself in novelty of <span class='it'>tone</span> as in
novelty of matter. Mr. Hawthorne is original at <span class='it'>all</span> points.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be a matter of some difficulty to designate the
best of these tales, we repeat that, without exception,
they are beautiful. “Wakefield” is remarkable for the
skill with which an old idea—a well-known incident—is
worked up or discussed. A man of whims conceives the
purpose of quitting his wife and residing <span class='it'>incognito</span>, for
twenty years, in her immediate neighborhood. Something
of this kind actually happened in London. The force of
Mr. Hawthorne’s tale lies in the analysis of the motives
which must or might have impelled the husband to such
folly, in the first instance, with the possible causes of his
perseverance. Upon this thesis a sketch of singular power
has been constructed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Wedding Knell” is full of the boldest imagination—an
imagination fully controlled by taste. The most captious
critic could find no flaw in this production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Minister’s Black Veil” is a masterly composition
of which the sole defect is that to the rabble its exquisite
skill will be <span class='it'>caviare</span>. The <span class='it'>obvious</span> meaning of this article
will be found to smother its insinuated one. The <span class='it'>moral</span> put
into the mouth of the dying minister will be supposed to
convey the <span class='it'>true</span> import of the narrative; and that a crime
of dark dye, (having reference to the “young lady”) has
been committed, is a point which only minds congenial
with that of the author will perceive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Higginbotham’s Catastrophe” is vividly original
and managed most dexterously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dr. Heidegger’s Experiment” is exceedingly well
imagined, and executed with surpassing ability. The
artist breathes in every line of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The White Old Maid” is objectionable, even more than
the “Minister’s Black Veil,” on the score of its mysticism.
Even with the thoughtful and analytic, there will be much
trouble in penetrating its entire import.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Hollow of the Three Hills” we would quote in
full, had we space;—not as evincing higher talent than any
of the other pieces, but as affording an excellent example
of the author’s peculiar ability. The subject is commonplace.
A witch subjects the Distant and the Past to the
view of a mourner. It has been the fashion to describe, in
such cases, a mirror in which the images of the absent appear;
or a cloud of smoke is made to arise, and thence the
figures are gradually unfolded. Mr. Hawthorne has wonderfully
heightened his effect by making the ear, in
place of the eye, the medium by which the fantasy is conveyed.
The head of the mourner is enveloped in the cloak
of the witch, and within its magic folds there arise sounds
which have an all-sufficient intelligence. Throughout this
article also, the artist is conspicuous—not more in positive
than in negative merits. Not only is all done that should
be done, but (what perhaps is an end with more difficulty
attained) there is nothing done which should not be.
Every word <span class='it'>tells</span>, and there is not a word which does
<span class='it'>not</span> tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In “Howe’s Masquerade” we observe something which
resembles a plagiarism—but which <span class='it'>may be</span> a very flattering
coincidence of thought. We quote the passage in
question.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>With a dark flush of wrath</span> upon his brow they saw the
general <span class='it'>draw his sword</span> and <span class='it'>advance to meet</span> the figure <span class='it'>in
the cloak</span> before the latter had stepped one pace upon the
floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>Villain, unmuffle yourself</span>,’ cried he, ‘you pass no farther!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The figure, without blenching a hair’s breadth from
the sword which was pointed at his breast, made a solemn
pause, and <span class='it'>lowered the cape of the cloak</span> from his face, yet
not sufficiently for the spectators to catch a glimpse of it.
But Sir William Howe had evidently seen enough. The
sternness of his countenance gave place to a look of wild
amazement, if not horror, while he recoiled several steps
from the figure, <span class='it'>and let fall his sword</span> upon the floor.”—See
vol. 2, page 20.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The idea here is, that the figure in the cloak is the phantom
or reduplication of Sir William Howe; but in an article
called “William Wilson,” one of the “Tales of the
Grotesque and Arabesque,” we have not only the same
idea, but the same idea similarly presented in several respects.
We quote two paragraphs, which our readers may
compare with what has been already given. We have
italicized, above, the immediate particulars of resemblance.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had
been sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change
in the arrangement at the upper or farther end of the room.
A large mirror, it appeared to me, now stood where none
had been perceptible before: and as I stepped up to it in
extremity of terror, mine own image, but with features all
pale and dabbled in blood, <span class='it'>advanced</span> with a feeble and tottering
gait to meet me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thus it appeared I say, but was not. It was Wilson,
who then stood before me in the agonies of dissolution.
Not a line in all the marked and singular lineaments of that
face which was not even identically mine own. <span class='it'>His mask
and cloak lay where he had thrown them, upon the floor.</span>”—Vol.
2. p. 57.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here it will be observed that, not only are the two
general conceptions identical, but there are various <span class='it'>points</span>
of similarity. In each case the figure seen is the wraith or
duplication of the beholder. In each case the scene is a
masquerade. In each case the figure is cloaked. In each,
there is a quarrel—that is to say, angry words pass between
the parties. In each the beholder is enraged. In
each the cloak and sword fall upon the floor. The “villain,
unmuffle yourself,” of Mr. H. is precisely paralleled by a
passage at page 56 of “William Wilson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the way of objection we have scarcely a word to say
of these tales. There is, perhaps, a somewhat too general
or prevalent <span class='it'>tone</span>—a tone of melancholy and mysticism.
The subjects are insufficiently varied. There is not so
much of <span class='it'>versatility</span> evinced as we might well be warranted
in expecting from the high powers of Mr. Hawthorne.
But beyond these trivial exceptions we have
really none to make. The style is purity itself. Force
abounds. High imagination gleams from every page. Mr.
Hawthorne is a man of the truest genius. We only regret
that the limits of our Magazine will not permit us to pay
him that full tribute of commendation, which, under other
circumstances, we should be so eager to pay.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Vigil of Faith, and Other Poems. By C. F. Hoffman,
Author of “Greyslaer,” &amp;c. S. Coleman: New York.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Charles Fenno Hoffman is well known as the author
of several popular novels, and as the quondam editor of
the “American Monthly Magazine;” but his poetical abilities
have not as yet attracted that attention which is indubitably
their due.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Vigil of Faith,” a poem of fifty-two irregular
stanzas, embodies a deeply interesting narrative supposed
to be related by an Indian encountered by the author
in a hunting excursion amid the Highlands of the Hudson.
It bears the impress of the true spirit upon every line; but
appears to be carelessly written.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The occasional Poems are scarcely more beautiful, but,
in general, are more complete and polished. Now and
then, however, we observe, even in these, an inaccurate
rhythm. Here, for example, in “Moonlight on the Hudson,”
page 63, we note a foot too much⁠—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
<p class='line0'>“Or cradle-freighted Ganges, the reproach of mothers.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>This line is not used as an Alexandrine, but occurs in the
body of a stanza. Mr. Hoffman is, also, somewhat too
fond of a double rhyme, which, unduly employed, never
fails to give a flippant air to a serious poem. It is not improbable
that we shall speak more fully of this really beautiful
volume hereafter. Its external or mechanical appearance
excels that of any book we have seen for a long time.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Life of Lorenzo de’ Medici, called the Magnificent.
By William Roscoe. From the London Edition, Corrected.
In Two Volumes. Carey &amp; Hart: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The genius of Lorenzo de’ Medici has never, perhaps,
been so highly estimated, as his exertions on behalf of
Italian literature. Yet he was not only an author unsurpassed
by any of his illustrious contemporaries, but, as a
statesman, gave evidence of profound ability. A week
illustrating the value of his character and discussing his
vast influence upon his age, has been long wanting, and
no man lives who could better supply the <span class='it'>desideratum</span> than
Mr. Roscoe. In republishing these volumes Messieurs
Carey &amp; Hart have rendered a service of the highest importance
to the reading public of America.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Poets and Poetry of America. With an Historical Introduction.
By Rufus W. Griswold. Carey &amp; Hart:
Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a volume of remarkable beauty externally, and
of very high merit internally. It embraces selections from
the poetical works of every true poet in America without
exception; and these selections are prefaced, in each instance,
with a brief memoir, for whose accuracy we can
vouch. We know that no pains or expense have been
spared in this compilation, which is, by very much indeed,
the best of its class—affording, at one view, the justest
idea of our poetical literature. Mr. Griswold is remarkably
well qualified for the task he has undertaken. We
shall speak at length of this book in our next.</p>

By the Author of “Richard Hurdis,” “Border Beagles,”
etc. Two Volumes. Lea &amp; Blanchard: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The events upon which this novel is based are but too
real. No more thrilling, no more romantic tragedy did
ever the brain of poet conceive than was the tragedy of
Sharpe and Beauchampe. We are not sure that the author
of “Border Beagles” has done right in the selection of his
theme. Too little has been left for invention. We are
sure, however, that the theme is skilfully handled. The
author of “Richard Hurdis” is one among the best of our
native novelists—pure, bold, vigorous, original.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
